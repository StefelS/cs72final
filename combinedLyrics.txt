Anyways
It's KIDZ BOP o'clock, yeah, it's 6:30
I've been through a lot, but I'm still workin' (okay)
Is everybody back up in the buildin'?
It's been a minute, tell me how you're healin'?
'Cause I'm about to get into my feelings
How you're feelin'? How you feel right now?
Oh, I've been so down and under pressure
I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be
Uh, but I might be better
Turn up the music, turn down the lights
I got a feelin', I'm gon' be alright
Okay (okay), alright
It's about that time
Turn up the music, let's celebrate (alright)
I got a feelin', I'm gon' be okay
Okay (okay), alright

I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the most awesome time of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the most awesome time of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
...
I don't know what you've been told
But time is runnin' out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe to toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so
But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Keepin' dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (right now)
Swimmin' in the flood, dancin' on the clouds below
I ain't worried 'bout it (hey)
I don't know what you been told
But time is runnin' out, so spend it like it's gold
...
(Release ya anger, release ya mind)
(Release ya job, release the time)
(Release ya trade, release the stress)
(Release the love, forget the rest)
You won't break my soul, you won't break my soul
You won't break my soul, you won't break my soul
I'm tellin' everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Now, I just fell in love and I just quit my job
I'm gonna find new drive
Yeah, they work me so, so hard
Work by nine, then off past five
And they work my nerves, that's why I cannot sleep at night
I'm lookin' for motivation
I'm lookin' for a new foundation, yeah
And I'm on that new vibration
I'm buildin' my own foundation, yeah
Hold up, oh, baby, baby
You won't break my soul (nah, nah)
You won't break my soul (no-no, nah, nah)
You won't break my soul (no-no, nah, nah)
You won't break my soul (nah, nah)
Everybody (nah, nah)
Everybody
...
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my obsession works the graveyard shift
All of the people, I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prizes and prices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming (for the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

Te bloqueé en Insta
Pero por otra cuenta veo tus historias
Tu número lo borré
No sé pa' qué si me lo sé de memoria
Me hiciste daño y así te extraño
Y aunque sé que un día te voy a olvidar
Aún no lo hago es complicado
To' lo que hicimo' me gusta recordar
Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste
Te diría que volvieras pero eso no se pide
...
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
Ever since the d-day y-you went away
(No, I don't know how)
How to erase your image from out my brain
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
Maybe I should just focus on me instead
(But all I think about)
Are the times you were tangled up in my head
Oh, no (oh, no)
Oh, no (oh, no)
You're goin' 'round in circles
Got you stuck up in my head, yeah
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you ovеr here
You take up еvery corner of my mind
Your love stays with me day and night
...
Por completarte me rompí en pedazos
Me lo advirtieron pero no hice caso
Me di cuenta que lo tuyo es falso
Fue la gota que rebasó el vaso
No me digas que lo sientes
Eso parece sincero, pero te conozco bien y sé que mientes
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien actúas
De eso no me cabe duda
Con tu papel continúa
Te queda bien ese show
Te felicito, qué bien ac-
Su filosofía barata no la compro
Lo siento, en esa moto ya no me monto

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza (Giza)
So I'm to the left like the tower out of Pisa (Pisa)
I'm feeling single baby I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar
I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the coliseum (coliseum)
I'll be Davinci if you be my Mona Lisa now smile
And pack your bags real good baby, 'Cause you'll be gone for a while (while)
(Oo-oo- oo) Ha
Girl tell me how you feel
Where you wanna be
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my senorita
We don't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want it's yours
...
Hace mucho tiempo le hago caso al corazón
Y pasan los día', los mese' pensando en tu olor (tu olor, tu olor)
Ha llegado el tiempo para usar la razón
Antes que sea tarde y sin querer me parta en do' (parta en do')
Antes de que salga el sol, hunde el acelerador
Aunque vaya sin freno' y pierda el control
Nada má' seremos do', tú y yo, moriendo no?
En medio del tiempo, sin decir adió'
Y solo mírame con esos ojitos lindos
Y con eso yo estoy bien, hoy he vuelto a nacer
Hace tiempo (tiempo) que no agarro a nadie de la mano (mano)
...
Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me gone
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
...
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming
Football's coming home
It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming
Football's coming home
Everyone seems to know the score, they've seen it all before
They just know, they're so sure
That England's gonna throw it away, gonna blow it away
But I know they can play 'cause I remember
Three lions on a shirt
Jules Rimet still gleaming
30 years of hurt
Never stopped me dreaming
So many jokes, so many sneers
...
No se habla de Bruno, no, no, no
No se habla de Bruno
Mas
Justo en mi boda fue (en nuestra boda fue)
Todo estaba listo con un clima precioso esa vez (ninguna nube esa vez)
Bruno con voz misteriosa habló (¡trueno!)
¿Tú cuentas la historia o lo hago yo? (lo siento, mi vida, hazlo tú)
Veo que pronto lloverá (¿qué insinuaba?)
Sabrás que lo tomé muy mal (abuela, ten la sombrilla)
Boda en un huracán (fue un día feliz, pero es verdad)
No se habla de Bruno, no, no, no
No se habla de Bruno (hey)
Miedo al ver a Bruno balbuceando y tropezando
Siempre lo recuerdo murmurando y farfullando
Su sonido es como la arena al resbalar
Raro el don de ir visualizando

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas Day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight (tonight) I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know (you know)
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday
Alone to celebrate
But then (but then), one day (one day)
Everything changed
You're all I need
...
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give my heart away
If he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus
When I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
...
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
...
Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Prospero año y felicidad
Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Prospero año y felicidad
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
From the bottom of my heart
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas
...
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
...
So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
A new one just begun
So this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear one
The old and the young
A very merry Christmas
And a happy new year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
And so this is Christmas, yeah (war is over)
For weak and for strong (if you want it)
...
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
...
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've bought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
As long as you love me so
...
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
...
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you
Shawty, with you
With you
Shawty, with you
With you
Under the mistletoe, yeah
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeers flyin' through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you
...
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
...
Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
...
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye
Ooh
...
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile upon somebody's face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing, and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the bells ring out for Christmas
...
I can see the magic feel it in the air
Christmas lights twinkling everywhere
I'll be at your side waiting up all night
To hear reindeer lands on the roof
Ain't about what's under the tree
Long as i can be somewhere with you
And so i run back home to people i love
Ooh, the day is finally over
I look around and see
The magic of christmas everywhere
Everywhere in the streets
In the streets bells are ringing
Merry caroling here i'm singing
Merry christmas may your wishes come true
And that's from me to you
La la la la la
La la la la la la (the magic of christmas everywhere)
We're sipping some others could decorate in my tree
Right here together couldn't be better
...
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel (you're a heel)
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch
I'm a bad banana with a
Greasy black peel
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch
You wouldn't touch me with a

You know Dasher and Dancer,
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid,
And Donner and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Reindeer)
...
It's Christmas
Baby, please come home
Yeah
(Christmas) the snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) watch the people around
(Christmas) baby, please come home
(Christmas) the church bells in town
(Christmas) they're ringing a song
(Christmas) what a happy sound
(Christmas) baby, please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
...
Come, they told me, pa-rum, pum, pum, pum

Our finest gifts we bring, pa-rum, pum, pum, pum
To lay before the King, pa-rum, pum, pum, pum

We won't go until we got some
We won't go until we got some
...
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, yeah
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos, oh, ooh
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
...
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
...
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Oh, Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
...
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
...
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there is a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of streetlights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
...

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
Don't want a doll
No dinky Tinkertoy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do
I can see me now on Christmas morning
...
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la

Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la

You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
With cold kiss from Santa
You'll tie tigger
With Dancer and Prancer
Go, go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the mistletoe
Til we drop!
Dancin' all night
Lets go baby go go go.
Here's my favorite holiday,
My favorite time of year.
With cards we write,
A Christmas lights all wrapped
With Christmas cheer.
Gifts we give are memories
Will make it fall someday
We wish we had our history
When troubles go away
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
...
Christmas, Christmastime is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a hula-hoop
We can hardly stand the wait
...
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning
Oh they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
They sailed into Bethlehem
...
Bah Humbug; now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
...
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greetings
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
...
Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes around on a special night?
Santa comes around on a special night
Special Night, beard that's white
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus
Who wears boots and a suit of red?
Santa wears boots and a suit of red
Who wears a long cap on his head?
Santa wears a long cap on his head
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus
...
Up on the house top reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
First comes of stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa, fill it well
Give her a dollie that laughs and cries
One that will open and shut her eyes
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the house top, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
...
Noche de paz
Noche de amor
Todo duerme en derredor
Entre los astros
Que esparcen su luz
Viene anunciando al Niño Jesus
Brilla la estrella de paz
Brilla la estrella de paz

Spooky, scary skeletons
Send shivers down your spine
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
Seal your doom tonight
Spooky, scary skeletons
Speak with such a screech
You'll shake and shudder in surprise
When you hear these zombies shriek
We're so sorry, skeletons
You're so misunderstood
You only want to socialize
But I don't think we should
'Cause spooky, scary skeletons
Shout startling shrilly screams
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won't let you be
...
Ghostbusters
If there's something strange in your neighborhood
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
If there's something weird and it don't look good
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
If you're seeing things runnin' through your head
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
...
Up in the graveyard, there's a party
Everyone's welcome, everybody
Come meet the werewolves, meet the zombies
It's a good time when you're frightening, yeah
So come one, come all, what you waiting for?
The goblins are already on the floor
The skeleton choir starts to sing their song
So sing along
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's a spooky scene at my Halloween party
What a supernatural night
Howling at the moonlight
All the ghosts feel alright
'Til the sun stars coming up, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Come dance with me at my Halloween party
...
Boys and girls of every age
Wouldn't you like to see something strange?
Come with us and you will see
This, our town of Halloween
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Pumpkins scream in the dead of night
This is Halloween, everybody make a scene
Trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright
It's our town, everybody scream
In this town of Halloween
I am the one hiding under your bed
Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red
I am the one hiding under yours stairs
Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair
This is Halloween, this is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, Halloween
In this town we call home
Everyone hail to the pumpkin song
In this town, don't we love it now?
Everybody's waiting for the next surprise
...
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
On my life, on my head (don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
...
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do
He said that
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice
And then the witch doctor
He game me this advice
He said that
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
...
Ooh
Here come the Men In Black
It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's
Here come the Men In Black
(Men In Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me, MIB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't brink be what was there is now gone
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
(Ooh, ooh)
'Cause you never quite know where the MIB's is at
Uh, eh
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
Galaxy defenders
Oho oho oho
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
They won't let you remember
(Won't let you remember)
Aha, aha
Now, from the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like boom black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
...
They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams Family
Their house is a museum
Where people come to see-em
They really are a scream
The Addams Family
Neat
Sweet
Petite
...
Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
...
Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life?
Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life? (Yeah)
I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm f- sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking
So, tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
You can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life?
Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you
Like I don't mind if you ruin my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you
...
Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-eee"
It looks like a purple eater to me
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough"
...
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your smile these times when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is everything
I miss you more than life
...
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got a bit surprised late last night
Werewolves of London again
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We got some work to do now
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now
Come on Scooby Doo, I see you
Pretending you got a sliver
But you're not fooling me 'cause I can see
The way you shake and shiver
You know we got a mystery to solve
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
Little shop, little shoppa horrors
Little shop, little shoppa terror
Call a cop, little shoppa horrors
No, oh, oh, no-oh!
Little shop, little shoppa horrors
Bop sh-bop, little shoppa terror
Watch 'em drop, little shoppa horrors
No, oh, oh, no-oh!
Shing-a-ling, what a creepy thing
To be happenin'
...
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
So take a look what you've done
And baby now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinkin' that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Saltin' the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
...
Hey! Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
Ding-dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below Yo-ho
Let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding-dong, the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead
Ding-dong, the witch is dead (yeah)
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that I did that summer night, night
Lost in the feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
...
Candy girl
My girls like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me
Candy girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day
All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
The way you walk
And the way you talk
You always look so good
You make me forget my thoughts
(Do you really love me?) Do you really love me?
(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
...
In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say no, I've got some plans for the night
And then I stop, and say, all right
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
You always keep me guessin
...
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
...
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But the evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet this devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
...
Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her finger tips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight
Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman she got the moon in her eye
...
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it but
We build this right
So nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
...
Recuérdame
Hoy me tengo que ir, mi amor
Recuérdame
No llores, por favor
Te llevo en mi corazón y cerca me tendrás
A solas yo te cantaré, soñando en regresar
Recuérdame
Aunque tenga que emigrar
Recuérdame
...
Ahahahahahahahaha
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna bring it tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
...
I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
They caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
...
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
I know someone who's tough but sweet
Oh so fine, he can't be beat
He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
...
Forget you and your mom and your sister and your job
And that broke-down car and the things you call art
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all get lost
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start, hmm
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I know for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affеction
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna bе nice
...
Look out for yourself!
I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, betray us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Me, me, me, me
Look out for yourself!
My enemy
...
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
...
You're my cold heart
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardend by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passing through
(No, no, no, no, no)
And I think it's gonna be a long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the one they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
...
You said you hated the oceans but you're surfing now
I said I'd love you for life but they just sold our house
We were kids from the start
Feels like we're grown-ups now, mm
Couldn't ever imagine ever having doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now when I'm dancing with strangers you could be casually dating
Oh, it's all changing so fast
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life baby
Yeah love comes around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life baby
I was barely standing, but now I'm dancing
He's all that I need (goza)
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam (así es la vida)
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam (uh-huh)
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam (uh-huh)
Bidi-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam (uh-huh)

You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe, and I
In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, the sun will rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes
매일 밤 네게 날아가 (가)
꿈이란 것도 잊은 채
나 웃으며 너를 만나 (나)
Never-ending forever, baby
You (you), you are (you are) my universe
And I (I) just want (just want) to put you first
And you (you), you are (you are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day (it was our wedding day)
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
(No clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (thunder)
You telling this story, or am I? (I'm sorry, mi vida, go on)
Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain (Abuela, get the umbrellas)
Married in a hurricane (what a joyous day, but anyway)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno
Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering and stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (ch-ch-ch)
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
...
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, what?
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot
Caught a vibe (what now?)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna see you tonight, night
When we catch a vibe (what now?)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life
...
Jeje
Es una voz
Hay un rayo de luz
Que entró por mi ventana
Y me ha devuelto las ganas
Me quita el dolor
Tu amor es uno de esos
Que te cambia, te profeso
Que me pone a volar
Mi pedazo de sol
La niña de mis ojos
Tiene una colección
De corazones rotos
Mi pedazo de sol
La niña de mis ojos
La que baila sin razon
Con tacones rojos
Y me pone a volar
La que me hace llorar
La que me hace sufrir
Pero no paro de amar
Porque me hizo sentir
Que gane la lotería
Antes de ella no sabía que alguien podía amarme así
Ah ah ah ah ah
Para la la
Ah
...
Travelling in a fried out combie
On a hippie trail head full of zombies
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in, and gave me breakfast
And she said
"Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder?
...
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
...
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my friends, we jump around wit it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my friends, we jump around wit it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it
All my friends, we jump around wit it
Bounce wit it, drop wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it, snap wit it

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold, alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
But the cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
...
Ooh, yeah, feels like there's something in the air
Ooh, yeah, it's like there's magic everywhere
So, come on, take a chance and let go
If you wanna dance, just say so
Ooh, yeah, 'cause I got some moves I wanna share
It's a couple little steps
So learn them real quick
Simple as this
Let's go!
Put your hands up high, slide to the side
Feeling alright, yeah
Step back to the front, move how you want
Party all night, yeah
Put your hands up high, slide to the side
Feeling alright, yeah
Step back to the front, move how you want
Party all night, yeah
KIDZ BOP! Never, never stop
Never, never stop, oh-oh-oh
KIDZ BOP! Never, never stop
Never, never stop, oh-oh-oh

You want the girl who's in first place
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say it's not that hard
But I just got a feeling
This will maybe go too far
If you say she's nothing to worry about
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?
Silly boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad
...
On n'a pas les tours de New York
On n'a pas les lumières du jour
Six mois dans l'année
On n'a pas Beaubourg ni la Seine
On n'est pas la ville de l'amour
Mais bon, vous voyez
Et sûrement que dès ce soir le ciel couvrira une tempête
Mais après l'orage, avec des potes, les gens feront la fête
Bruxelles, je t'aime, Bruxelles, je t'aime (tu m'avais manqué)
Bruxelles, je t'aimе, Bruxelles, je t'aimе (t'es ma préférée)
Bruxelles, je t'aime, Bruxelles, je t'aime (tu m'avais manqué)
T'es la plus belle, oui, t'es la plus belle
Paris m'appelle
Quand je veux rentrer chez moi
Quand le ciel gris et la pluie me manquent
Je vais mieux quand j'te vois
Les villes sont belles
...
I've been feeling lonely
I need someone to tell me
Come on baby tell me
Yeah, I been feeling jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it
Now you, you been moving on
Let me know can I come along
Since you're gone, oh it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own
Living in a haze
Staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break
Can I get an amen
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Oh, oh
...
Son las seis de la mañana y me da igual
Voy a salir a la calle, voy a ponerme a gritar
Voy a gritar que te quiero, que te quiero de verdad
Con esa sonrisa puesta
De verdad que no me cuesta
Pensar en ti cuando me acuesto
Pero Aitana, no imagines el resto
Que si no, no queda bonito esto
Voy a ir directo a ti
Voy a mirarte a los ojos, no te voy a mentir
Y como dos niños chicos, te pediré salir (no, no)
Esperando un sí, esperando un kiss (mua)
Y es que me encantas tanto
Si me miras mientras canto
Se me pone cara tonto (tonta)
Niño (niña), tú me tienes loco (loca)
Y es que me gustas no sé cuánto
"Gogoko zaitut", como dirían los vascos
Si quieres te lo digo en portugués
Eu gosto de você
Se me paraliza el cuerpo cuando vas a cantarme
Me acuerdo de ti cuando voy a arreglarme
Cantando en los conciertos, te imagino delante
...
You're just like my favorite song, going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song, going 'round and 'round my head (hey)
Five days on the freeway riding right next to you (yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fast lane, we got big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)
Playing Sweet Child O' Mine
And I still feel that line
Where are you now?
Where are you now? (Hey)
Hey, it's been too long
Too long to go, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around (hey)
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long
You're just like my favorite song, going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song, going 'round and 'round my head
...
I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, "Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?"
Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack
The straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's
Pressure, like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa, oh, oh
...
I got lost in the wilderness
I thought I was surely falling apart
The pain you caused hurt so deep
Truly was a work of art
I don't care what they say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Oh-oh, oh-oh
It's the only thing I see, always staring back at me
Oh-oh
I've been left in the dark
Standing cold in the night
Memories of your face I've been holding on tight
Falling apart, and I'm living a lie
All of this time I've been loving a liar
Pulled me in with your word so sweet
...
Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the morning
When they got home from work
Making plans to travel 'round the world
Said we always put each other first
All love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I've lost you
Now I remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice
Just tryna fix you and all your elder issues
But now I don't even miss you anymore
So I, I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent giving advice on how to write your songs
...
Lo que pasó, a ti te lo cuento
No creas que no dolió o que me lo invento
Así es que se dio
Yo tenía mi bebé, era algo bien especial
Pero me pasioné con algo que a él le salía mal
Miles de cancione' en mi mente, y él me lo notaba
Él tanta' vece' que me lo decía, y yo como si nada
Es mala amiga la fama y no va a quererte de verdad
Es demasiao traicionera, y como ella viene, se te va
Sabe que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
...
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never see
My, ooh
My, ooh
Every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but
I sacrifice (sacrifice)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down)
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
...
In nur einem Moment kann sich alles dreh'n
Wir hab'n uns schon so lang nach diesem Tag gesehnt
Der Himmel voller Lichter, wir sind mittendrin
Und jeder Schritt bis jetzt macht plötzlich Sinn
Wie oft haben wir gelacht und geweint
Nur um hier und jetzt Geschichte zu schreiben?
Ich will, dass dieses Gefühl für immer bleibt
Jeder Pulsschlag, null auf 100
Und ich weiß, dass du das Gleiche fühlst wie ich
Wenn die Euphorie durch deine Adern schießt
Weil der Augenblick jetzt alles für uns ist
Jeder Pulsschlag, null auf 100
Und auf einmal steht die Welt kurz still
...
You never know how good you have it, oh-oh
Until you're starin' at a picture of the only girl that matters, ah-ah
I know what we're supposed to do
It's hard for me to let go of you
So I'm just tryna hold on
Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slipping through my fingertipsa little bit, by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on
I need to learn how to cope without you
...
Y a plein d'pages dans le livrets, ouais
Toute une vie à écrire
Quand tu mettras un "j'suis libre", ouais
Le ciel sait c'que je prie
Peu importe les démons, eh
Peu importe le mal qu'on s'fait
Les semaines passent comme des secondes
Mais c'est toujours toi que j'vois quand mes yeux se referment
S'il suffisait d'un claquement de doigts
Pour sceller nos sorts jusqu'à l'éternité
Je claquerais, je claquerais des doigts toute la nuit
Je chercherais ton regard dans la brume
Jusqu'à la rosée du matin
Oh-oh, ma petite étoile
Ma petite étoile, ma petite étoile qui s'illumine
Ma petite étoile, t'es venue briller dans ma vie
Ma petite étoile, ma petite étoile qui s'illumine
Ma petite étoile, t'es venue briller dans ma vie
...
Spin you around on the chandeliers
Head over heels like tears for fears
Your love, no, I can't get enough (uh)
Losing my cool, but I'm staying alive
Dance in the rain just to kiss the night
Your love, oh, it fits like a glove
Oh-oh, ay
Don't need drama
I just need one word to get to you
So tell me now, do you want it?
'Cause these dancing feet don't cry to the rhythm, they cry for you
And every Saturday night that you ain't here, my tears are blue
And these blinding lights, they shine so bright like we're on the moon
But I don't wanna dance another beat, no, unless it's with you
Dancing feet, feet, feet
Dancing feet, feet (I don't wanna dance)
I don't wanna dance another beat, no, unless it's with you
Tell me, who do I call when I lose my mind
Out in the morning and I'm on fire?
It's you that I'm running to
You got a diamond heart, you're a work of art
...
Oh, my love, where did you go?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
With all my love, where did you go now?
Where did you go now? I wanna know
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love
Where did you go?
With my love, with my love (oh-oh-oh)
You just have to walk in the place
And all eyes (and all eyes) are on you (are on you)
You could put a smile on your face
And you'd light up the room
But then you left me dancing on the floor alone
And now the DJ's gone and all the lights are on
...
Alles was wir sehen, wohin wir gehen
Nur dieser Moment bleibt in der Sanduhr stehen
Wenn er echt ist
Ich erwart nicht viel von diesem Moment
Ich will dass er perfekt ist, dass er echt ist
(Dass er echt ist)
Und ich kann es noch gar nicht so richtig glauben
Doch du stehst hier direkt vor meinen Augen
Ich will dass es zwischen uns nicht nur so ein Affekt ist
Ich will dass es alles hier echt perfekt ist
Und ich glaub daran, dass es besser ist, wenn ich es fühlen kann
Für diesen einen Augenblick sind alle meine Zweifel weg
Weil es echt ist
Und ich glaub daran, dass es besser ist, wenn ich es fühlen kann
Für diesen einen Augenblick sind alle meine Zweifel weg
Weil es echt ist
Egal wo wir stehen, wohin wir gehen
...
Caught up in Heaven, but your Heaven ain't the same
And I've never been a saint, have I?
This evanescence always fleeting like a flame
But I'm never one to change, am I?
Call it a lesson when I feel you slide away
And I'm missin' out on half my life
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete
You make mе complete
You make mе a complete mess
...
Dos oruguitas enamoradas
Pasan sus noches y madrugadas
Llenas de hambre siguen andando
Y navegando un mundo
Que cambia y sigue cambiando
Navegando un mundo
Que cambia y sigue cambiando
Dos oruguitas paran el viento
Mientras se abrazan con sentimiento
Siguen creciendo, no saben cuándo
Buscar algún rincón
El tiempo sigue cambiando
Inseparables son
El tiempo sigue cambiando
Ay, oruguitas, no se aguanten más
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Every time you come around, you know you can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, you let it take control
You can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
These bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger you barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
You've got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
These bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And you know you'll lose control of the things that you say
Yeah, you were lookin' for a way out, now you can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
...
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
...
Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey-yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
Ayy
My girl is singing, she's so low maintenance
She needs some fun KIDZ BOP entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, and she so happy
We like to dip all our fries in our Frosty
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like soda in the styrofoam
We're singing in the truck loud all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my everything tonight (hey)
...
I took an arrow to the heart
I never saw a face that looks like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Playing on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmh, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna know your eyes
I wanna see that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
...
Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mm, mm-mm
So sweet
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I'll be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm-mm, yeah)
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)
All your other friends are busy hangin' with babies (ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (nah)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)
Forget all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shake (whoa)
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Looking at your smile was like heaven
We were taking it slow
Walking in the streets until the evening
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other's names
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Thinking of your smile in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
...
They don't know you do it for the culture, ah man
They say you should watch the stuff you post, come on, man
Say you turnin' big girls to the most, yeah, ah yeah
They say we get crazy at our shows, yeah, ah yeah
All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya heard, that's true, yeah
I know him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that
Had to cut some friends loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them friends tryna tell me
Yeah, I don't give enough
All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been talking to you, yeah
Focused on this music
My old friends, they blew it
Last year, I thought I would lose it
Readin' things on the internet
...
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes
You would be a hundred dollars
If feelin' fine was a crime
Yeah, they would've put it all there up in a tower
The way you sing like you do
Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'
Do a lil' spin, do it again
Yeah, look like you plan for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
...
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...

...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't chanched
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say
Money ain't a thing club jumping like kidz bop now yeah dance with me we're going around homie we about to clown why 'cause its about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
End of the day, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)
Al otro día volvemo' (oh, yeah)
Tú sabes cómo lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (of the night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (oh, yeah)
We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo
¡Ritmo!
No son ni Reebook ni son Nike (no)
Sin estilista, luzco fly (yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (mamacita)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (Mamacita)
Ella no le baja, nunca tumba
Siempre está lista pa' la rumba
Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (tú eres lo que yo necesito)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Porque tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (nadie como yo pa' ti)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres perfecta (perfecta)
Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta

Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
I'm doing just fine, now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind
If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm going around on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
...
Si tú me dices ahorita
Que me quieres a tu lao
Que lindo sería
Si tú con esa boquita
Ya me tienes embobado
Yo te besaría
Pero no me dices
Kesí kesí kesí kesí
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
La gente me dice que ya es muy obvio que ya se me nota
Que estoy más intenso que un niño con una pelota
Cuando tú bailas me prendo automático
Me pongo a pensarte romántico
Como un astronauta lunático fanático
Tú y yo sabemos que es sin filtro eres más bella
Me gusta que tú nunca te photoshopeas
Dime, ¿Qué hacemos entonces?
...
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
Oo-wee
It's my fantasy
The beautiful landscape
I paint before my inner eye
Yeah, can't you see
The river the treetops
I'm swimming naked with one eye to the sky
And the other to the deep dark and blue
It's pulling us through to the other side
There's no reason to hide
When we all are the universe
Connecting now and then
Making us feel like humans again
It's familiar yet so strange
But we need the reminder
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
I've been dreaming of nature
...
Manchmal fühl ich mich hier falsch wie ein Segelschiff im All
Aber bist du mit mir an Bord, bin ich gerne durchgeknallt
Selbst der Stau auf der A2 ist mit dir blitzschnell vorbei
Und die Plörre von der Tanke schmeckt wie Kaffee auf Hawaii, yeah
Auch wenn ich schweig, du weißt Bescheid
Ich brauch gar nichts sagen, ein Blick reicht
Und wird uns der Alltag hier zu grau
Pack ich dich ein, wir sind dann mal raus
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
Dafür, dass du mich so gut kennst
Bei dir kann ich ich sein, verträumt und verrückt sein, na-na-na-na-na-na
Danke Lieblingsmensch, schön, dass wir uns kenn'n
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
...
Ich wart seit Wochen, auf diesen Tag
Und tanz vor Freude, über den Asphalt
Als wär's ein Rythmus, als gäb's ein Lied
Das mich immer weiter, durch die Straßen zieht
Komm dir entgegen, dich abzuholen, wie ausgemacht
Zu der selben Uhrzeit, am selben Treffpunkt, wie letztes mal
Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge
Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg
Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen
Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik
Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Every time you come around, you know you can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, you let it take control
You can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
These bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger you barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
You've got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
These bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And you know you'll lose control of the things that you say
Yeah, you were lookin' for a way out, now you can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
...
Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey-yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I took an arrow to the heart
I never saw a face that looks like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Playing on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmh, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna know your eyes
I wanna see that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
...
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...

I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
...
Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mm, mm-mm
So sweet
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I'll be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm-mm, yeah)
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)
All your other friends are busy hangin' with babies (ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (nah)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)
Forget all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shake (whoa)
...
Looking at your smile was like heaven
We were taking it slow
Walking in the streets until the evening
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other's names
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Thinking of your smile in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
...
They don't know you do it for the culture, ah man
They say you should watch the stuff you post, come on, man
Say you turnin' big girls to the most, yeah, ah yeah
They say we get crazy at our shows, yeah, ah yeah
All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya heard, that's true, yeah
I know him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that
Had to cut some friends loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them friends tryna tell me
Yeah, I don't give enough
All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been talking to you, yeah
Focused on this music
My old friends, they blew it
Last year, I thought I would lose it
Readin' things on the internet
...
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes
You would be a hundred dollars
If feelin' fine was a crime
Yeah, they would've put it all there up in a tower
The way you sing like you do
Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'
Do a lil' spin, do it again
Yeah, look like you plan for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
...
I'm doing just fine, now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind
If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm going around on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't chanched
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say
Money ain't a thing club jumping like kidz bop now yeah dance with me we're going around homie we about to clown why 'cause its about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
End of the day, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm

Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)
Al otro día volvemo' (oh, yeah)
Tú sabes cómo lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (of the night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (oh, yeah)

No son ni Reebook ni son Nike (no)
Sin estilista, luzco fly (yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (mamacita)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (Mamacita)
Ella no le baja, nunca tumba
Siempre está lista pa' la rumba
Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (tú eres lo que yo necesito)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Porque tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (nadie como yo pa' ti)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres perfecta (perfecta)
Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta

¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí (Jaja)
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready (Hey)

Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados

Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado

Si tú me dices ahorita
Que me quieres a tu lao
Que lindo sería
Si tú con esa boquita
Ya me tienes embobado
Yo te besaría
Pero no me dices
Kesí kesí kesí kesí
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
La gente me dice que ya es muy obvio que ya se me nota
Que estoy más intenso que un niño con una pelota
Cuando tú bailas me prendo automático
Me pongo a pensarte romántico
Como un astronauta lunático fanático
Tú y yo sabemos que es sin filtro eres más bella
Me gusta que tú nunca te photoshopeas
Dime, ¿Qué hacemos entonces?
...
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
Oo-wee
It's my fantasy
The beautiful landscape
I paint before my inner eye
Yeah, can't you see
The river the treetops
I'm swimming naked with one eye to the sky
And the other to the deep dark and blue
It's pulling us through to the other side
There's no reason to hide
When we all are the universe
Connecting now and then
Making us feel like humans again
It's familiar yet so strange
But we need the reminder
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
I've been dreaming of nature

Manchmal fühl ich mich hier falsch wie ein Segelschiff im All
Aber bist du mit mir an Bord, bin ich gerne durchgeknallt
Selbst der Stau auf der A2 ist mit dir blitzschnell vorbei
Und die Plörre von der Tanke schmeckt wie Kaffee auf Hawaii, yeah
Auch wenn ich schweig, du weißt Bescheid
Ich brauch gar nichts sagen, ein Blick reicht
Und wird uns der Alltag hier zu grau
Pack ich dich ein, wir sind dann mal raus
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
Dafür, dass du mich so gut kennst
Bei dir kann ich ich sein, verträumt und verrückt sein, na-na-na-na-na-na
Danke Lieblingsmensch, schön, dass wir uns kenn'n
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
...
Ich wart seit Wochen, auf diesen Tag
Und tanz vor Freude, über den Asphalt
Als wär's ein Rythmus, als gäb's ein Lied
Das mich immer weiter, durch die Straßen zieht
Komm dir entgegen, dich abzuholen, wie ausgemacht
Zu der selben Uhrzeit, am selben Treffpunkt, wie letztes mal
Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge
Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg
Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen
Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik
Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Every time you come around, you know you can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, you let it take control
You can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
These bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger you barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
You've got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
These bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And you know you'll lose control of the things that you say
Yeah, you were lookin' for a way out, now you can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
...
Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey-yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I'm doing just fine, now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind
If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm going around on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
...
I took an arrow to the heart
I never saw a face that looks like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Playing on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmh, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna know your eyes
I wanna see that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Looking at your smile was like heaven
We were taking it slow
Walking in the streets until the evening
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other's names
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Thinking of your smile in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
...
They don't know you do it for the culture, ah man
They say you should watch the stuff you post, come on, man
Say you turnin' big girls to the most, yeah, ah yeah
They say we get crazy at our shows, yeah, ah yeah
All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya heard, that's true, yeah
I know him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that
Had to cut some friends loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them friends tryna tell me
Yeah, I don't give enough
All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been talking to you, yeah
Focused on this music
My old friends, they blew it
Last year, I thought I would lose it
Readin' things on the internet
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...

Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mm, mm-mm
So sweet
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I'll be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm-mm, yeah)
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)

Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)
Forget all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shake (whoa)
...
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes
You would be a hundred dollars
If feelin' fine was a crime
Yeah, they would've put it all there up in a tower
The way you sing like you do
Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'
Do a lil' spin, do it again
Yeah, look like you plan for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
...
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget

Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)
Al otro día volvemo' (oh, yeah)

(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (of the night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (oh, yeah)

Sin estilista, luzco fly (yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (mamacita)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (Mamacita)
Ella no le baja, nunca tumba
Siempre está lista pa' la rumba
Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (tú eres lo que yo necesito)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Porque tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (nadie como yo pa' ti)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres perfecta (perfecta)
Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta

Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
Si tú me dices ahorita
Que me quieres a tu lao
Que lindo sería
Si tú con esa boquita
Ya me tienes embobado
Yo te besaría
Pero no me dices
Kesí kesí kesí kesí
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
La gente me dice que ya es muy obvio que ya se me nota
Que estoy más intenso que un niño con una pelota
Cuando tú bailas me prendo automático
Me pongo a pensarte romántico
Como un astronauta lunático fanático
Tú y yo sabemos que es sin filtro eres más bella
Me gusta que tú nunca te photoshopeas
Dime, ¿Qué hacemos entonces?
...
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
Oo-wee
It's my fantasy
The beautiful landscape
I paint before my inner eye
Yeah, can't you see
The river the treetops
I'm swimming naked with one eye to the sky
And the other to the deep dark and blue
It's pulling us through to the other side
There's no reason to hide
When we all are the universe
Connecting now and then
Making us feel like humans again
It's familiar yet so strange
But we need the reminder
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)

Manchmal fühl ich mich hier falsch wie ein Segelschiff im All
Aber bist du mit mir an Bord, bin ich gerne durchgeknallt
Selbst der Stau auf der A2 ist mit dir blitzschnell vorbei
Und die Plörre von der Tanke schmeckt wie Kaffee auf Hawaii, yeah
Auch wenn ich schweig, du weißt Bescheid
Ich brauch gar nichts sagen, ein Blick reicht
Und wird uns der Alltag hier zu grau
Pack ich dich ein, wir sind dann mal raus
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
Dafür, dass du mich so gut kennst
Bei dir kann ich ich sein, verträumt und verrückt sein, na-na-na-na-na-na
Danke Lieblingsmensch, schön, dass wir uns kenn'n
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
...
Ich wart seit Wochen, auf diesen Tag
Und tanz vor Freude, über den Asphalt
Als wär's ein Rythmus, als gäb's ein Lied
Das mich immer weiter, durch die Straßen zieht
Komm dir entgegen, dich abzuholen, wie ausgemacht
Zu der selben Uhrzeit, am selben Treffpunkt, wie letztes mal
Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge
Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg
Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen
Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik
Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Every time you come around, you know you can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, you let it take control
You can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
These bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger you barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
You've got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
These bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And you know you'll lose control of the things that you say
Yeah, you were lookin' for a way out, now you can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
...
Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey-yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I took an arrow to the heart
I never saw a face that looks like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Playing on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmh, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna know your eyes
I wanna see that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...

Looking at your smile was like heaven
We were taking it slow
Walking in the streets until the evening
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other's names
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Thinking of your smile in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
...
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
...
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't changed
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say

And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time

I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
Ayy
My girl is singing, she's so low maintenance
She needs some fun KIDZ BOP entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, and she so happy
We like to dip all our fries in our Frosty
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like soda in the styrofoam
We're singing in the truck loud all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my everything tonight (hey)
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mm, mm-mm
So sweet
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I'll be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm-mm, yeah)
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)
All your other friends are busy hangin' with babies (ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (nah)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)
Forget all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shake (whoa)
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
They don't know you do it for the culture, ah man
They say you should watch the stuff you post, come on, man
Say you turnin' big girls to the most, yeah, ah yeah
They say we get crazy at our shows, yeah, ah yeah
All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya heard, that's true, yeah
I know him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that
Had to cut some friends loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them friends tryna tell me
Yeah, I don't give enough
All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been talking to you, yeah
Focused on this music
My old friends, they blew it
Last year, I thought I would lose it
Readin' things on the internet
...
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes
You would be a hundred dollars
If feelin' fine was a crime
Yeah, they would've put it all there up in a tower
The way you sing like you do
Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'
Do a lil' spin, do it again
Yeah, look like you plan for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
I'm doing just fine, now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind
If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm going around on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...

Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene

Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
Si tú me dices ahorita
Que me quieres a tu lao
Que lindo sería
Si tú con esa boquita
Ya me tienes embobado
Yo te besaría
Pero no me dices
Kesí kesí kesí kesí
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
Ay tú no me dices
Kesi kesi kesi kesi
La gente me dice que ya es muy obvio que ya se me nota
Que estoy más intenso que un niño con una pelota
Cuando tú bailas me prendo automático
Me pongo a pensarte romántico
Como un astronauta lunático fanático
Tú y yo sabemos que es sin filtro eres más bella
Me gusta que tú nunca te photoshopeas
Dime, ¿Qué hacemos entonces?
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine

Every time you come around, you know you can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, you let it take control
You can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
These bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger you barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
You've got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
These bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And you know you'll lose control of the things that you say
Yeah, you were lookin' for a way out, now you can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
These bad habits lead to you

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance any more
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave

Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So, put your loving hand out, darling
Riding high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, but you warned me then
But easy come, and easy go, and it would end
So, any time I bleed, you let me go
Yeah, any time I feed, you get me know
Any time I seek, you let me know
But I plan and see, just let me go
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey-yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes

I took an arrow to the heart
I never saw a face that looks like yours
Strawberries and somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Playing on my guitar (ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmh, you got me feeling like
I wanna be that guy
I wanna know your eyes
I wanna see that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you say it like that

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It's five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
'Cause my wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
And it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

We like to dip all our fries in our Frosty
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like soda in the styrofoam
We're singing in the truck loud all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my everything tonight (hey)
...
Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mm, mm-mm
So sweet
Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I'll be makin' lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mm-mm, yeah)
Hey, little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (woo)
All your other friends are busy hangin' with babies (ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (nah)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate? (Mmm)
Put some sugar in my water (yuh) 'cause we makin' Minute Maid (woo)
Forget all the hate (uh), do a shimmy-shake (whoa)
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Looking at your smile was like heaven
We were taking it slow
Walking in the streets until the evening
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each other's names
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Thinking of your smile in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
...
They don't know you do it for the culture, ah man
They say you should watch the stuff you post, come on, man
Say you turnin' big girls to the most, yeah, ah yeah
They say we get crazy at our shows, yeah, ah yeah
All the rumors are true, yeah
What ya heard, that's true, yeah
I know him and you, yeah
If you believe I do that
Had to cut some friends loose, yeah
NDA, no loose lips
Now them friends tryna tell me
Yeah, I don't give enough
All the rumors are true, yeah
I've been talking to you, yeah
Focused on this music
My old friends, they blew it
Last year, I thought I would lose it
Readin' things on the internet
...
Oh my, oh my
In a room full of dimes
You would be a hundred dollars
If feelin' fine was a crime
Yeah, they would've put it all there up in a tower
The way you sing like you do
Ooh, it's like you do it for a livin'
Do a lil' spin, do it again
Yeah, look like you plan for the win, oh, baby
I'm tryna roll, I'm tryna ride
I'm tryna float, I'm tryna glide
No, no, don't be shy, just take my hand and hold on tight
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
Slide your way on over (Slide your way on over)
Oh, skate to me, baby (Skate)
...
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
I'm doing just fine, now it's over
I've been moving on and living my life
But occasionally I lose composure
And I can't get you out of my mind
If I could go back in time
I'd do things differently, yeah, I wouldn't think twice
I distract myself, think of someone else
But every now and then you remind me
It's only when I'm going around on my own
And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It's in the moments where I think that I'm better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember
Every time I walk past your house in the rain
...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't chanched
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say

Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
End of the day, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
Oo-wee
It's my fantasy
The beautiful landscape
I paint before my inner eye
Yeah, can't you see
The river the treetops
I'm swimming naked with one eye to the sky
And the other to the deep dark and blue
It's pulling us through to the other side
There's no reason to hide
When we all are the universe
Connecting now and then
Making us feel like humans again
It's familiar yet so strange
But we need the reminder
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
(Oo-wee) I can feel the satellites around my brain
(Oo-wee) it's the moment when they land I can't explain
(Oo-wee) it's a secret (ssh)
Don't tell it (ssh)
And I've been dreaming of nature
I was planted in the garden long ago
I've been dreaming of nature

Manchmal fühl ich mich hier falsch wie ein Segelschiff im All
Aber bist du mit mir an Bord, bin ich gerne durchgeknallt
Selbst der Stau auf der A2 ist mit dir blitzschnell vorbei
Und die Plörre von der Tanke schmeckt wie Kaffee auf Hawaii, yeah
Auch wenn ich schweig, du weißt Bescheid
Ich brauch gar nichts sagen, ein Blick reicht
Und wird uns der Alltag hier zu grau
Pack ich dich ein, wir sind dann mal raus
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
Dafür, dass du mich so gut kennst
Bei dir kann ich ich sein, verträumt und verrückt sein, na-na-na-na-na-na
Danke Lieblingsmensch, schön, dass wir uns kenn'n
Hallo Lieblingsmensch, ein Riesenkompliment
...
Ich wart seit Wochen, auf diesen Tag
Und tanz vor Freude, über den Asphalt
Als wär's ein Rythmus, als gäb's ein Lied
Das mich immer weiter, durch die Straßen zieht
Komm dir entgegen, dich abzuholen, wie ausgemacht
Zu der selben Uhrzeit, am selben Treffpunkt, wie letztes mal
Durch das Gedränge, der Menschenmenge
Bahnen wir uns den altbekannten Weg
Entlang der Gassen, zu den Rheinterrassen
Über die Brücken, bis hin zu der Musik
Wo alles laut ist, wo alle drauf sind, um durchzudreh'n
...
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist you found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better one for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Yeah, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
...
There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys blow (oh!)
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a white whale boar
The Captain called all hands
And swore he'd take that whale in tow (uh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey!)
One day when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
...
Sind Fragen da, hast du 'nen Plan
Planst du zu viel, bin ich spontan
Und machst du zu, geh ich offen damit um (damit um)
Flieg ich mal zu hoch, fängst du mich ein
Über mein'n Schatten springen wir zu zweit
Hätt nie gedacht, dass wir mal so weit komm'n
Oh, es kann so leicht sein, sich zu verlier'n
Doch bei dir weiß ich
Oh, du bleibst bei mir
Wer, wenn nicht wir?
Geh'n zusamm'n durch alle Zeiten
Was auch passiert, wir beide bleiben, wir bleiben
Sag mir, wo, wenn nicht hier?
Fangen wir an, zu begreifen
Dass die kleinen Dinge reichen?
Dass sie reichen mit dir
...
You know we're finally here right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then, then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are full of (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this right now (now, now), yeah
It's been too long since we thought crazy
I'm low-key spinnin' out
I'm counting down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know 'em all in the bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
And it's weekend all the way, yeah
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?) (We want the weekend)
...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
...
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
...
Wie kann das sein?
Erst hast du dich verrannt und dann verkeilt
Trägst es rum und fühlst dich ganz allein
Warum machst du dich so klein? Frisst das alles in dich rein (in dich rein)
Ich erkenn dich nicht
Fühlst dich, als ob du im Gefängnis bist
Stehst vor 'nem Berg und siehst das Ende nicht
Hast du vergessen, wer du bist? Du warst mal Optimist
Bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
Bist du zu stolz und hast dich deshalb weggedreht?
Ich kam zurück und hab von Weitem schon geseh'n, dass du dich quälst
Sag, bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
...
Ich denke viel zu oft an morgen
Wo will ich hin und wer will ich sein?
Ist meine Zukunft schon geschrieben?
Treff ich dich oder bleib ich doch allein?
Es sind die immer gleichen Fragen
Ich schlafe wieder mal nicht ein
Ey, find ich Liebe? Find ich Frieden?
Was ich weiß? Dass ich gar nichts weiß
Ich kann das Gestern und das Morgen eh nicht lenken
Also denk ich in Momenten
Die guten Zeiten, die sind jetzt
Ich hoff, dass du es nie vergisst
...
I called you back yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you with a smile on my face
With all that talking you don't even have to try
You're cool enough to hang with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but yeah, you gotta live it right
Singin' and dancin' with your friends
You live in the dark, yeah, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to win
If you ain't in the garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
...
Astro-naut
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool (that's right)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe that you don't know me
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play here for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
...
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what is this that you're talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk about me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
...
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in those ropes (your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (no more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on the mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (loved by you)
La, la, la-la, la
...
Baby, now and then
I think about me now, and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh-woah
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite, if I can't decide, baby
My head and my heart are torturin' me, yeah
'Cause my mind and your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run and monsters call it love, oh-oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
When the two of you walked in the other n-n-n-night
Saw you smilin' with your arms around his si-si-si-side
How I hate the hand in your hand wasn't m-m-m-mine
How I hate myself, I didn't treat you r-r-r-right
But I only want the best for you, trust me
Even if I know the best for you is not me
And the worst is I know I'm the reason why-why-why-why
You said goodbye-bye-bye-bye
He doesn't love you like I love you
He doesn't need you like I need you, no
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
He doesn't know you like I know you
'Cause baby, I know every part of you
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
Guess I don't deserve you
Like I love you
Like I, like I love you, na-na-na
Like I love you
...
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I say, oh (oh), the way I breathe you in (in)
It's the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, I've never felt this much
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
...
(Woo) if you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (hey)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
...
It was only you and I
But now I feel like I am trapped inside
A life that doesn't feel right
It's not me, it's not me
I thought you're my ride or die
But our love died on the ride
And we tried 'til it turned to lies
And you see, don't you see?
Yeah, no, we never gonna be like that
And I never gonna feel like that
You're looking over your shoulder, like I'ma hold ya back
Why you sound like such a grab?
When you said you quit on that
You don't know how it feels
Why you take my love just to rip it up?
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
Take my love just to rip it up
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
...
Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm breaking a sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let us show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)
...
I get up, I get down, and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feeling grown
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go)
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends saying, "You're so unique", hm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
...
¿Quién lo diría
Que se podría sentir el amor por telepatía?
La luna está llena, mi mente vacía
Lo que te diría
Si no estuvieras corriendo mi mente, no te buscaría
Todos los días, todos los días
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y te extraño cuando no me estas hablando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
...
It's like you've got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 2020 days
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly, too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (trust me)
The way that you trust me (trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
...
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Be with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh gosh, runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (no, no, no, no, no, no no no)
...
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
...
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get, can't you see
Still couldn't never get you to agree
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with this look on you
Coco Chanel on your neck, with it all in check
Lovin' all the time with you
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see me back
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, whoa
...
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He maybe feel like a million, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see him with my eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my keys too many times
And when he started acting up, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks, when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
...
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
...
Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
...
When you walk there in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your head then don't give up the fight
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you walk there in the morning
...
You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year I've been a shell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast
'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
...
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleeping together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (marriage)
I don't want marriage (oh)
I rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (oh, no)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (oh, yeah)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (hey)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
...
You know sometimes
I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again 'til the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than another
I'm more than another, I'm your friend
...
Ah, yeah!
Ey, ey!
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
Aaah, you're lookin' for
A girl like me (La-La-Latinas, ¡ey!)
I want a girl like you, yeah! (ey!)
Esa latina está linda (¡ah!)
I want a familiar chica
Que sepa vivir y que viva la vida
Annie es bien bonita (¡wuh!)
Elegante y señorita (¡wuh!)
Girl, I want to get to know ya
All of my life, yep!
Baby, let's team up!
I want a girl that shine like glitter (ping!)
A girl that don't need no filter
The real for real
A girl that's a natural dancer (prrr!)
I wanna girl that's a singer (yes!)
Singing love off the meter (yes!)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero
...
One, two
One, two, three
Let's go
(Let's go)
El viento soba tu cabello
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me encanta que nos conocemos
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me gusta tu flow
Ese fiel corazón
Y como me haces reir
Lo que el sol necesita
Mi mejor amiga
Y como confias en mí
Contigo yo quiero cantar
A la misma vez bailar
...
Cumbia
La temperatura caliente
Gotas de sudor en la frente
Luna llena, luna creciente
De igual manera
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Con eso es suficiente, DJ dale, ponla de repente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Solo para que celebren y sacar las cargas de la mente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Hasta en otro continente, que me lo bailen como parientes
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Ay, qué ritmo que se siente cuando te mueves, te mueves, te mueves
Esto es para que disfruten, pero sin acose
Para toda mi gente que lo gocen
Cumbia pa' que muevan, cumbia pa' que goce
Pa' bailarla por el día y después de las 12
Baila sabrocito, pero sin evitar choqué
...
Y avait pas d'image, y avait pas d'couleur
Y avait pas d'histoire, mon âme sœur
Y avait pas les fêtes, y avait pas l'cœur
Aucun sourire, mon âme sœur
Tu sais le monde ne tournait pas rond
J'avais les mots mais pas la chanson
Tu sais l'amour, tu sais la passion
Oui, c'est écrit, c'était dit
Oui, c'est la vie
Avant toi, je n'avais rien
Avant toi, on n'm'a pas montré le chemin
Je sais, le Ciel ne m'en veut pas
D'avoir posé les yeux sur toi
...
Mes amis entendaient la vie que j'ai eu
Où les gens m'attendaient, je n'suis pas venu
Si je les emmêle, si je dérange
C'est qu'je suis un pêle-mêle, un mélange
J'suis trop compliqué
Je... n'choisirai jamais que les deux côtés
Ne... me demandez pas où je veux aller
Même les singes singent les sages
Et tous ces sages ont fait des cages
Où tous nous ranger
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
...
Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, I'm a wreck
And when I see you, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
...
Hi
Hi-hi, hi, hi-hi
Oh, oh, oh
Manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo
Mami oh, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh
Oh, le temps, le temps m'a réparé
Plus rien n'est comme avant, quelqu'un m'a déjà soigné
Oh, oh, le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps, une autre a su me soigner
Toi là, tu disparais sans laisser un mot
T'as préféré fuir comme un enfant (enfant)
Partir sans te retourner
J't'ai prêté mon cœur et tu lui as donné ton dos
Toi tu m'as fait gaspiller mon temps (mon temps)
Tu n'm'as pas laissé parler (ah, hi)
Et maintenant (maintenant)
...
Les mots me manquent
Pourtant j'aimerais crier
Muette saltimbanque à la gorge nouée
Et ça monte, ça monte, ça monte
Jusqu'à c'que mon petit cœur disjoncte
Et ça fait bim, bam, boum
Ça fait pshht et ça fait vroum
Ça fait bim, bam, boum
Dans ma tête y a tout qui tourne
Ça fait shht et puis blabla
Ça fait comme-ci, comme-ça
Ça fait bim, bam, ha ha ha
Dans mon cœur, je comprends pas
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
...
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist you found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better one for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Yeah, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
...
(Woo) if you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (hey)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
...
I called you back yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you with a smile on my face
With all that talking you don't even have to try
You're cool enough to hang with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but yeah, you gotta live it right
Singin' and dancin' with your friends
You live in the dark, yeah, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to win
If you ain't in the garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
...
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I say, oh (oh), the way I breathe you in (in)
It's the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, I've never felt this much
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
...
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
...
Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm breaking a sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let us show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)
...
Astro-naut
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool (that's right)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe that you don't know me
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play here for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
...
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
...
I get up, I get down, and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feeling grown
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go)
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what is this that you're talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk about me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends saying, "You're so unique", hm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
...
¿Quién lo diría
Que se podría sentir el amor por telepatía?
La luna está llena, mi mente vacía
Lo que te diría
Si no estuvieras corriendo mi mente, no te buscaría
Todos los días, todos los días
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y te extraño cuando no me estas hablando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
...
It's like you've got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 2020 days
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly, too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (trust me)
The way that you trust me (trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
...
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Be with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh gosh, runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (no, no, no, no, no, no no no)
...
Baby, now and then
I think about me now, and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh-woah
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite, if I can't decide, baby
My head and my heart are torturin' me, yeah
'Cause my mind and your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run and monsters call it love, oh-oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys blow (oh!)
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a white whale boar
The Captain called all hands
And swore he'd take that whale in tow (uh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey!)
One day when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
...
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
...
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get, can't you see
Still couldn't never get you to agree
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with this look on you
Coco Chanel on your neck, with it all in check
Lovin' all the time with you
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see me back
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, whoa
...
You know we're finally here right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then, then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are full of (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this right now (now, now), yeah
It's been too long since we thought crazy
I'm low-key spinnin' out
I'm counting down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know 'em all in the bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
And it's weekend all the way, yeah
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?) (We want the weekend)
...
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in those ropes (your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (no more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on the mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (loved by you)
La, la, la-la, la
...
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He maybe feel like a million, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see him with my eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my keys too many times
And when he started acting up, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks, when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
...
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
...
Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
...
When you walk there in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your head then don't give up the fight
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you walk there in the morning
...
You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year I've been a shell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast
'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
...
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleeping together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (marriage)
I don't want marriage (oh)
I rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (oh, no)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (oh, yeah)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (hey)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
...
You know sometimes
I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again 'til the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than another
I'm more than another, I'm your friend
...
Ah, yeah!
Ey, ey!
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
Aaah, you're lookin' for
A girl like me (La-La-Latinas, ¡ey!)
I want a girl like you, yeah! (ey!)
Esa latina está linda (¡ah!)
I want a familiar chica
Que sepa vivir y que viva la vida
Annie es bien bonita (¡wuh!)
Elegante y señorita (¡wuh!)
Girl, I want to get to know ya
All of my life, yep!
Baby, let's team up!
I want a girl that shine like glitter (ping!)
A girl that don't need no filter
The real for real
A girl that's a natural dancer (prrr!)
I wanna girl that's a singer (yes!)
Singing love off the meter (yes!)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero
...
One, two
One, two, three
Let's go
(Let's go)
El viento soba tu cabello
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me encanta que nos conocemos
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me gusta tu flow
Ese fiel corazón
Y como me haces reir
Lo que el sol necesita
Mi mejor amiga
Y como confias en mí
Contigo yo quiero cantar
A la misma vez bailar
...
Cumbia
La temperatura caliente
Gotas de sudor en la frente
Luna llena, luna creciente
De igual manera
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Con eso es suficiente, DJ dale, ponla de repente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Solo para que celebren y sacar las cargas de la mente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Hasta en otro continente, que me lo bailen como parientes
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Ay, qué ritmo que se siente cuando te mueves, te mueves, te mueves
Esto es para que disfruten, pero sin acose
Para toda mi gente que lo gocen
Cumbia pa' que muevan, cumbia pa' que goce
Pa' bailarla por el día y después de las 12
Baila sabrocito, pero sin evitar choqué
...
Wie kann das sein?
Erst hast du dich verrannt und dann verkeilt
Trägst es rum und fühlst dich ganz allein
Warum machst du dich so klein? Frisst das alles in dich rein (in dich rein)
Ich erkenn dich nicht
Fühlst dich, als ob du im Gefängnis bist
Stehst vor 'nem Berg und siehst das Ende nicht
Hast du vergessen, wer du bist? Du warst mal Optimist
Bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
Bist du zu stolz und hast dich deshalb weggedreht?
Ich kam zurück und hab von Weitem schon geseh'n, dass du dich quälst
Sag, bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
...
It was only you and I
But now I feel like I am trapped inside
A life that doesn't feel right
It's not me, it's not me
I thought you're my ride or die
But our love died on the ride
And we tried 'til it turned to lies
And you see, don't you see?
Yeah, no, we never gonna be like that
And I never gonna feel like that
You're looking over your shoulder, like I'ma hold ya back
Why you sound like such a grab?
When you said you quit on that
You don't know how it feels
Why you take my love just to rip it up?
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
Take my love just to rip it up
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
...
When the two of you walked in the other n-n-n-night
Saw you smilin' with your arms around his si-si-si-side
How I hate the hand in your hand wasn't m-m-m-mine
How I hate myself, I didn't treat you r-r-r-right
But I only want the best for you, trust me
Even if I know the best for you is not me
And the worst is I know I'm the reason why-why-why-why
You said goodbye-bye-bye-bye
He doesn't love you like I love you
He doesn't need you like I need you, no
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
He doesn't know you like I know you
'Cause baby, I know every part of you
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
Guess I don't deserve you
Like I love you
Like I, like I love you, na-na-na
Like I love you
...
Sind Fragen da, hast du 'nen Plan
Planst du zu viel, bin ich spontan
Und machst du zu, geh ich offen damit um (damit um)
Flieg ich mal zu hoch, fängst du mich ein
Über mein'n Schatten springen wir zu zweit
Hätt nie gedacht, dass wir mal so weit komm'n
Oh, es kann so leicht sein, sich zu verlier'n
Doch bei dir weiß ich
Oh, du bleibst bei mir
Wer, wenn nicht wir?
Geh'n zusamm'n durch alle Zeiten
Was auch passiert, wir beide bleiben, wir bleiben
Sag mir, wo, wenn nicht hier?
Fangen wir an, zu begreifen
Dass die kleinen Dinge reichen?
Dass sie reichen mit dir
...
Ich denke viel zu oft an morgen
Wo will ich hin und wer will ich sein?
Ist meine Zukunft schon geschrieben?
Treff ich dich oder bleib ich doch allein?
Es sind die immer gleichen Fragen
Ich schlafe wieder mal nicht ein
Ey, find ich Liebe? Find ich Frieden?
Was ich weiß? Dass ich gar nichts weiß
Ich kann das Gestern und das Morgen eh nicht lenken
Also denk ich in Momenten
Die guten Zeiten, die sind jetzt
Ich hoff, dass du es nie vergisst
...
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
...
Y avait pas d'image, y avait pas d'couleur
Y avait pas d'histoire, mon âme sœur
Y avait pas les fêtes, y avait pas l'cœur
Aucun sourire, mon âme sœur
Tu sais le monde ne tournait pas rond
J'avais les mots mais pas la chanson
Tu sais l'amour, tu sais la passion
Oui, c'est écrit, c'était dit
Oui, c'est la vie
Avant toi, je n'avais rien
Avant toi, on n'm'a pas montré le chemin
Je sais, le Ciel ne m'en veut pas
D'avoir posé les yeux sur toi
...
Mes amis entendaient la vie que j'ai eu
Où les gens m'attendaient, je n'suis pas venu
Si je les emmêle, si je dérange
C'est qu'je suis un pêle-mêle, un mélange
J'suis trop compliqué
Je... n'choisirai jamais que les deux côtés
Ne... me demandez pas où je veux aller
Même les singes singent les sages
Et tous ces sages ont fait des cages
Où tous nous ranger
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
...
Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, I'm a wreck
And when I see you, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
...
Hi
Hi-hi, hi, hi-hi
Oh, oh, oh
Manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo
Mami oh, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh
Oh, le temps, le temps m'a réparé
Plus rien n'est comme avant, quelqu'un m'a déjà soigné
Oh, oh, le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps, une autre a su me soigner
Toi là, tu disparais sans laisser un mot
T'as préféré fuir comme un enfant (enfant)
Partir sans te retourner
J't'ai prêté mon cœur et tu lui as donné ton dos
Toi tu m'as fait gaspiller mon temps (mon temps)
Tu n'm'as pas laissé parler (ah, hi)
Et maintenant (maintenant)
...
Les mots me manquent
Pourtant j'aimerais crier
Muette saltimbanque à la gorge nouée
Et ça monte, ça monte, ça monte
Jusqu'à c'que mon petit cœur disjoncte
Et ça fait bim, bam, boum
Ça fait pshht et ça fait vroum
Ça fait bim, bam, boum
Dans ma tête y a tout qui tourne
Ça fait shht et puis blabla
Ça fait comme-ci, comme-ça
Ça fait bim, bam, ha ha ha
Dans mon cœur, je comprends pas
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist you found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better one for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Yeah, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
...
One, two
One, two, three

I called you back yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you with a smile on my face
With all that talking you don't even have to try
You're cool enough to hang with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but yeah, you gotta live it right
Singin' and dancin' with your friends
You live in the dark, yeah, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to win
If you ain't in the garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
...
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (oh, no)

I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I say, oh (oh), the way I breathe you in (in)
It's the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, I've never felt this much
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
...
Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm breaking a sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let us show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)

(Woo) if you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (hey)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
...
Astro-naut
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool (that's right)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe that you don't know me
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play here for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
...
¿Quién lo diría
Que se podría sentir el amor por telepatía?
La luna está llena, mi mente vacía
Lo que te diría
Si no estuvieras corriendo mi mente, no te buscaría
Todos los días, todos los días
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y te extraño cuando no me estas hablando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
You know sometimes
I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again 'til the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than another
I'm more than another, I'm your friend
...
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends saying, "You're so unique", hm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
...
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
...
I get up, I get down, and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feeling grown
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go)
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what is this that you're talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk about me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
It's like you've got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 2020 days
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly, too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (trust me)
The way that you trust me (trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
...
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Be with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh gosh, runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (no, no, no, no, no, no no no)
...
Baby, now and then
I think about me now, and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh-woah
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite, if I can't decide, baby
My head and my heart are torturin' me, yeah
'Cause my mind and your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run and monsters call it love, oh-oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys blow (oh!)
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a white whale boar
The Captain called all hands
And swore he'd take that whale in tow (uh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey!)
One day when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
...
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
...
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get, can't you see
Still couldn't never get you to agree
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with this look on you
Coco Chanel on your neck, with it all in check
Lovin' all the time with you
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see me back
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, whoa
...
You know we're finally here right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then, then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are full of (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this right now (now, now), yeah
It's been too long since we thought crazy
I'm low-key spinnin' out
I'm counting down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know 'em all in the bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
And it's weekend all the way, yeah
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?) (We want the weekend)
...
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in those ropes (your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (no more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on the mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (loved by you)
La, la, la-la, la
...
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He maybe feel like a million, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see him with my eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my keys too many times
And when he started acting up, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks, when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
...
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
...
Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
...
When you walk there in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your head then don't give up the fight
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you walk there in the morning
...
You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year I've been a shell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast
'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
...
Wie kann das sein?
Erst hast du dich verrannt und dann verkeilt
Trägst es rum und fühlst dich ganz allein
Warum machst du dich so klein? Frisst das alles in dich rein (in dich rein)
Ich erkenn dich nicht
Fühlst dich, als ob du im Gefängnis bist
Stehst vor 'nem Berg und siehst das Ende nicht
Hast du vergessen, wer du bist? Du warst mal Optimist
Bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
Bist du zu stolz und hast dich deshalb weggedreht?
Ich kam zurück und hab von Weitem schon geseh'n, dass du dich quälst
Sag, bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
...
It was only you and I
But now I feel like I am trapped inside
A life that doesn't feel right
It's not me, it's not me
I thought you're my ride or die
But our love died on the ride
And we tried 'til it turned to lies
And you see, don't you see?
Yeah, no, we never gonna be like that
And I never gonna feel like that
You're looking over your shoulder, like I'ma hold ya back
Why you sound like such a grab?
When you said you quit on that
You don't know how it feels
Why you take my love just to rip it up?
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
Take my love just to rip it up
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
...
When the two of you walked in the other n-n-n-night
Saw you smilin' with your arms around his si-si-si-side
How I hate the hand in your hand wasn't m-m-m-mine
How I hate myself, I didn't treat you r-r-r-right
But I only want the best for you, trust me
Even if I know the best for you is not me
And the worst is I know I'm the reason why-why-why-why
You said goodbye-bye-bye-bye
He doesn't love you like I love you
He doesn't need you like I need you, no
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
He doesn't know you like I know you
'Cause baby, I know every part of you
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
Guess I don't deserve you
Like I love you
Like I, like I love you, na-na-na
Like I love you
...
Sind Fragen da, hast du 'nen Plan
Planst du zu viel, bin ich spontan
Und machst du zu, geh ich offen damit um (damit um)
Flieg ich mal zu hoch, fängst du mich ein
Über mein'n Schatten springen wir zu zweit
Hätt nie gedacht, dass wir mal so weit komm'n
Oh, es kann so leicht sein, sich zu verlier'n
Doch bei dir weiß ich
Oh, du bleibst bei mir
Wer, wenn nicht wir?
Geh'n zusamm'n durch alle Zeiten
Was auch passiert, wir beide bleiben, wir bleiben
Sag mir, wo, wenn nicht hier?
Fangen wir an, zu begreifen
Dass die kleinen Dinge reichen?
Dass sie reichen mit dir
...
Ich denke viel zu oft an morgen
Wo will ich hin und wer will ich sein?
Ist meine Zukunft schon geschrieben?
Treff ich dich oder bleib ich doch allein?
Es sind die immer gleichen Fragen
Ich schlafe wieder mal nicht ein
Ey, find ich Liebe? Find ich Frieden?
Was ich weiß? Dass ich gar nichts weiß
Ich kann das Gestern und das Morgen eh nicht lenken
Also denk ich in Momenten
Die guten Zeiten, die sind jetzt
Ich hoff, dass du es nie vergisst
...
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
...
Y avait pas d'image, y avait pas d'couleur
Y avait pas d'histoire, mon âme sœur
Y avait pas les fêtes, y avait pas l'cœur
Aucun sourire, mon âme sœur
Tu sais le monde ne tournait pas rond
J'avais les mots mais pas la chanson
Tu sais l'amour, tu sais la passion
Oui, c'est écrit, c'était dit
Oui, c'est la vie
Avant toi, je n'avais rien
Avant toi, on n'm'a pas montré le chemin
Je sais, le Ciel ne m'en veut pas
D'avoir posé les yeux sur toi
...
Mes amis entendaient la vie que j'ai eu
Où les gens m'attendaient, je n'suis pas venu
Si je les emmêle, si je dérange
C'est qu'je suis un pêle-mêle, un mélange
J'suis trop compliqué
Je... n'choisirai jamais que les deux côtés
Ne... me demandez pas où je veux aller
Même les singes singent les sages
Et tous ces sages ont fait des cages
Où tous nous ranger
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même

Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, I'm a wreck
And when I see you, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
...
Hi
Hi-hi, hi, hi-hi
Oh, oh, oh
Manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo
Mami oh, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh
Oh, le temps, le temps m'a réparé
Plus rien n'est comme avant, quelqu'un m'a déjà soigné
Oh, oh, le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps, une autre a su me soigner
Toi là, tu disparais sans laisser un mot
T'as préféré fuir comme un enfant (enfant)
Partir sans te retourner
J't'ai prêté mon cœur et tu lui as donné ton dos
Toi tu m'as fait gaspiller mon temps (mon temps)
Tu n'm'as pas laissé parler (ah, hi)
Et maintenant (maintenant)
...
Les mots me manquent
Pourtant j'aimerais crier
Muette saltimbanque à la gorge nouée
Et ça monte, ça monte, ça monte
Jusqu'à c'que mon petit cœur disjoncte
Et ça fait bim, bam, boum
Ça fait pshht et ça fait vroum
Ça fait bim, bam, boum
Dans ma tête y a tout qui tourne
Ça fait shht et puis blabla
Ça fait comme-ci, comme-ça
Ça fait bim, bam, ha ha ha
Dans mon cœur, je comprends pas
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist you found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better one for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Yeah, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
...
I called you back yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you with a smile on my face
With all that talking you don't even have to try
You're cool enough to hang with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but yeah, you gotta live it right
Singin' and dancin' with your friends
You live in the dark, yeah, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to win
If you ain't in the garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
...
Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes

Hand on my forehead, I'm a wreck

Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
...

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
...
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I say, oh (oh), the way I breathe you in (in)
It's the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, I've never felt this much
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
...
Hi
Hi-hi, hi, hi-hi
Oh, oh, oh
Manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo
Mami oh, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh
Oh, le temps, le temps m'a réparé
Plus rien n'est comme avant, quelqu'un m'a déjà soigné
Oh, oh, le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps, une autre a su me soigner
Toi là, tu disparais sans laisser un mot
T'as préféré fuir comme un enfant (enfant)
Partir sans te retourner
J't'ai prêté mon cœur et tu lui as donné ton dos
Toi tu m'as fait gaspiller mon temps (mon temps)
Tu n'm'as pas laissé parler (ah, hi)
Et maintenant (maintenant)
...
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
...
Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm breaking a sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let us show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
You know we're finally here right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then, then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are full of (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this right now (now, now), yeah
It's been too long since we thought crazy
I'm low-key spinnin' out
I'm counting down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know 'em all in the bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
And it's weekend all the way, yeah
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?) (We want the weekend)
...
(Woo) if you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (hey)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
...
Astro-naut
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool (that's right)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe that you don't know me
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play here for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
...
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what is this that you're talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk about me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
...
Y avait pas d'image, y avait pas d'couleur
Y avait pas d'histoire, mon âme sœur
Y avait pas les fêtes, y avait pas l'cœur
Aucun sourire, mon âme sœur
Tu sais le monde ne tournait pas rond
J'avais les mots mais pas la chanson
Tu sais l'amour, tu sais la passion
Oui, c'est écrit, c'était dit
Oui, c'est la vie
Avant toi, je n'avais rien
Avant toi, on n'm'a pas montré le chemin
Je sais, le Ciel ne m'en veut pas
D'avoir posé les yeux sur toi
...
There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys blow (oh!)
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a white whale boar
The Captain called all hands
And swore he'd take that whale in tow (uh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey!)
One day when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
...
Les mots me manquent
Pourtant j'aimerais crier
Muette saltimbanque à la gorge nouée
Et ça monte, ça monte, ça monte
Jusqu'à c'que mon petit cœur disjoncte
Et ça fait bim, bam, boum
Ça fait pshht et ça fait vroum
Ça fait bim, bam, boum
Dans ma tête y a tout qui tourne
Ça fait shht et puis blabla
Ça fait comme-ci, comme-ça
Ça fait bim, bam, ha ha ha
Dans mon cœur, je comprends pas
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
...
Baby, now and then
I think about me now, and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh-woah
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite, if I can't decide, baby
My head and my heart are torturin' me, yeah
'Cause my mind and your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run and monsters call it love, oh-oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
...
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in those ropes (your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (no more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on the mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (loved by you)
La, la, la-la, la
...
I get up, I get down, and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feeling grown
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go)
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends saying, "You're so unique", hm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
...
¿Quién lo diría
Que se podría sentir el amor por telepatía?
La luna está llena, mi mente vacía
Lo que te diría
Si no estuvieras corriendo mi mente, no te buscaría
Todos los días, todos los días
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y te extraño cuando no me estas hablando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
...
It's like you've got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 2020 days
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly, too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (trust me)
The way that you trust me (trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
...
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Be with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh gosh, runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (no, no, no, no, no, no no no)
...
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get, can't you see
Still couldn't never get you to agree
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with this look on you
Coco Chanel on your neck, with it all in check
Lovin' all the time with you
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see me back
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, whoa
...
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He maybe feel like a million, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see him with my eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my keys too many times
And when he started acting up, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks, when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
...
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
...
Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
...
When you walk there in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your head then don't give up the fight
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you walk there in the morning
...
You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year I've been a shell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast
'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
...
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleeping together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (marriage)
I don't want marriage (oh)
I rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (oh, no)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (oh, yeah)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (hey)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
...
You know sometimes
I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again 'til the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than another
I'm more than another, I'm your friend
...
Ah, yeah!
Ey, ey!
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
Aaah, you're lookin' for
A girl like me (La-La-Latinas, ¡ey!)
I want a girl like you, yeah! (ey!)
Esa latina está linda (¡ah!)
I want a familiar chica
Que sepa vivir y que viva la vida
Annie es bien bonita (¡wuh!)
Elegante y señorita (¡wuh!)
Girl, I want to get to know ya
All of my life, yep!
Baby, let's team up!
I want a girl that shine like glitter (ping!)
A girl that don't need no filter
The real for real
A girl that's a natural dancer (prrr!)
I wanna girl that's a singer (yes!)
Singing love off the meter (yes!)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero
...
One, two
One, two, three
Let's go
(Let's go)
El viento soba tu cabello
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me encanta que nos conocemos
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me gusta tu flow
Ese fiel corazón
Y como me haces reir
Lo que el sol necesita
Mi mejor amiga
Y como confias en mí
Contigo yo quiero cantar
A la misma vez bailar
...
Cumbia
La temperatura caliente
Gotas de sudor en la frente
Luna llena, luna creciente
De igual manera
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Con eso es suficiente, DJ dale, ponla de repente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Solo para que celebren y sacar las cargas de la mente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Hasta en otro continente, que me lo bailen como parientes
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Ay, qué ritmo que se siente cuando te mueves, te mueves, te mueves
Esto es para que disfruten, pero sin acose
Para toda mi gente que lo gocen
Cumbia pa' que muevan, cumbia pa' que goce
Pa' bailarla por el día y después de las 12
Baila sabrocito, pero sin evitar choqué
...
Wie kann das sein?
Erst hast du dich verrannt und dann verkeilt
Trägst es rum und fühlst dich ganz allein
Warum machst du dich so klein? Frisst das alles in dich rein (in dich rein)
Ich erkenn dich nicht
Fühlst dich, als ob du im Gefängnis bist
Stehst vor 'nem Berg und siehst das Ende nicht
Hast du vergessen, wer du bist? Du warst mal Optimist
Bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
Bist du zu stolz und hast dich deshalb weggedreht?
Ich kam zurück und hab von Weitem schon geseh'n, dass du dich quälst
Sag, bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
...
It was only you and I
But now I feel like I am trapped inside
A life that doesn't feel right
It's not me, it's not me
I thought you're my ride or die
But our love died on the ride
And we tried 'til it turned to lies
And you see, don't you see?
Yeah, no, we never gonna be like that
And I never gonna feel like that
You're looking over your shoulder, like I'ma hold ya back
Why you sound like such a grab?
When you said you quit on that
You don't know how it feels
Why you take my love just to rip it up?
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
Take my love just to rip it up
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
...
When the two of you walked in the other n-n-n-night
Saw you smilin' with your arms around his si-si-si-side
How I hate the hand in your hand wasn't m-m-m-mine
How I hate myself, I didn't treat you r-r-r-right
But I only want the best for you, trust me
Even if I know the best for you is not me
And the worst is I know I'm the reason why-why-why-why
You said goodbye-bye-bye-bye
He doesn't love you like I love you
He doesn't need you like I need you, no
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
He doesn't know you like I know you
'Cause baby, I know every part of you
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
Guess I don't deserve you
Like I love you
Like I, like I love you, na-na-na
Like I love you
...
Sind Fragen da, hast du 'nen Plan
Planst du zu viel, bin ich spontan
Und machst du zu, geh ich offen damit um (damit um)
Flieg ich mal zu hoch, fängst du mich ein
Über mein'n Schatten springen wir zu zweit
Hätt nie gedacht, dass wir mal so weit komm'n
Oh, es kann so leicht sein, sich zu verlier'n
Doch bei dir weiß ich
Oh, du bleibst bei mir
Wer, wenn nicht wir?
Geh'n zusamm'n durch alle Zeiten
Was auch passiert, wir beide bleiben, wir bleiben
Sag mir, wo, wenn nicht hier?
Fangen wir an, zu begreifen
Dass die kleinen Dinge reichen?
Dass sie reichen mit dir
...
Ich denke viel zu oft an morgen
Wo will ich hin und wer will ich sein?
Ist meine Zukunft schon geschrieben?
Treff ich dich oder bleib ich doch allein?
Es sind die immer gleichen Fragen
Ich schlafe wieder mal nicht ein
Ey, find ich Liebe? Find ich Frieden?
Was ich weiß? Dass ich gar nichts weiß
Ich kann das Gestern und das Morgen eh nicht lenken
Also denk ich in Momenten
Die guten Zeiten, die sind jetzt
Ich hoff, dass du es nie vergisst
...
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist you found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better one for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Yeah, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
...
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-da-dum
...
I called you back yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you with a smile on my face
With all that talking you don't even have to try
You're cool enough to hang with me tonight
Looking at the table and I see the reason why
Baby, you living the life, but yeah, you gotta live it right
Singin' and dancin' with your friends
You live in the dark, yeah, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to win
If you ain't in the garden, you know that you can
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
...
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
In a whole other life, there was this boy that I knew
He maybe feel like a million, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see him with my eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my keys too many times
And when he started acting up, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks, when I heard this melody
And it went like
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo
...
You know we're finally here right?
Where are we?
It's Friday then, then Saturday, Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are Sunday (what?)
Their lives again, their lives are full of (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, 'gain, 'gain, 'gain
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this right now (now, now), yeah
It's been too long since we thought crazy
I'm low-key spinnin' out
I'm counting down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know 'em all in the bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
And it's weekend all the way, yeah
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?)
It's Friday again, it's Saturday, Sunday (what?) (We want the weekend)
...
Hello, it's me your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay
Sometimes it works out but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
...
I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
...
There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Blow, my bully boys blow (oh!)
She'd not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a white whale boar
The Captain called all hands
And swore he'd take that whale in tow (uh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum (hey!)
One day when the tonguing is done
We'll take our leave and go
Take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
...
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get, can't you see
Still couldn't never get you to agree
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with this look on you
Coco Chanel on your neck, with it all in check
Lovin' all the time with you
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see me back
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, whoa
...
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
And I say, oh (oh), the way I breathe you in (in)
It's the feeling from within
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh, I've never felt this much
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time
I got my peaches out in Georgia (yeah, that's it)
I got my dream with California (yeah, that's it)
I took my friend up to the North, yeah (yeah, that's it)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya
All I could want, all I can wish for
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Na-na (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh), yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
...
When you walk there in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you get a little lonely
And you lose your head then don't give up the fight
When you walk there in the morning, darling
I'll be by your side
When you walk there in the morning
...
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm breaking a sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let us show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber
Straight up, I (got ya)
...
Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Be with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)
Lookin' back on my life, you're the only good I've ever done (ever done)
...
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends saying, "You're so unique", hm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
...
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in those ropes (your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (no more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (by you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on the mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (yeah, yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (loved by you)
La, la, la-la, la
...
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, yeah
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what is this that you're talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk about me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
...
(Woo) if you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take us for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like (hey)
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You like me, I like you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I'm with you, all right, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars (hey)
We can go wherever, so let's say it now or never, baby
Nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
...
You nearly gave me a heart attack
When you said you're doin' well
Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year I've been a shell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast
'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
...
Astro-naut
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that thing in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
She say that I'm cool (that's right)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)
Don't believe that you don't know me
She keep playing me dumb (play me)
I'ma play here for fun (uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
...
I get up, I get down, and I'm jumping around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feeling grown
Been the time of my life, but I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (Here we go)
So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang (come hang)
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
¿Quién lo diría
Que se podría sentir el amor por telepatía?
La luna está llena, mi mente vacía
Lo que te diría
Si no estuvieras corriendo mi mente, no te buscaría
Todos los días, todos los días
You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y te extraño cuando no me estas hablando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
...
It's like you've got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 2020 days
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me
The way that you love me
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly, too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (trust me)
The way that you trust me (trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
...
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer, wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a-
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
Sometimes all I think about is you
...
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Oh gosh, runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (no, no, no, no, no, no no no)
...
Baby, now and then
I think about me now, and who I could have been
And then I picture all the perfect that we lived
'Til I cut the strings on your tiny violin, oh-woah
My mind's got a m-m-mind of its own right now
And it makes me hate me
I'll explode like a dynamite, if I can't decide, baby
My head and my heart are torturin' me, yeah
'Cause my mind and your arms, I go to extremes, yeah
When angels tell me run and monsters call it love, oh-oh
My head and my heart are caught in-between, yeah
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
...
I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
...
Yeah
So now he's your heaven (yeah)
You're lying to yourself and him to make me jealous (oh, no)
You put on such an act when you're sleeping together
All this 'cause I said I don't want marriage (marriage)
I don't want marriage (oh)
I rather go half on a baby
'Cause at least I know that it's not temporary (temporary)
And at least we'll share something that's real (oh, yeah)
I can tell that you're just tryna feel (oh, no)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas (oh, yeah)
Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea (hey)
Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na'
Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones
...
You know sometimes
I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'
Yeah-yeah
You're deep in water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again 'til the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than another
I'm more than another, I'm your friend
...
Ah, yeah!
Ey, ey!
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
So, they tell me that you lookin' for a girl like me
Aaah, you're lookin' for
A girl like me (La-La-Latinas, ¡ey!)
I want a girl like you, yeah! (ey!)
Esa latina está linda (¡ah!)
I want a familiar chica
Que sepa vivir y que viva la vida
Annie es bien bonita (¡wuh!)
Elegante y señorita (¡wuh!)
Girl, I want to get to know ya
All of my life, yep!
Baby, let's team up!
I want a girl that shine like glitter (ping!)
A girl that don't need no filter
The real for real
A girl that's a natural dancer (prrr!)
I wanna girl that's a singer (yes!)
Singing love off the meter (yes!)
Yo quiero, mira, yo quiero
...
One, two
One, two, three
Let's go
(Let's go)
El viento soba tu cabello
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me encanta que nos conocemos
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me gusta tu flow
Ese fiel corazón
Y como me haces reir
Lo que el sol necesita
Mi mejor amiga
Y como confias en mí
Contigo yo quiero cantar
A la misma vez bailar
...
Cumbia
La temperatura caliente
Gotas de sudor en la frente
Luna llena, luna creciente
De igual manera
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Con eso es suficiente, DJ dale, ponla de repente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Solo para que celebren y sacar las cargas de la mente
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Hasta en otro continente, que me lo bailen como parientes
Que le den cumbia a la gente
Ay, qué ritmo que se siente cuando te mueves, te mueves, te mueves
Esto es para que disfruten, pero sin acose
Para toda mi gente que lo gocen
Cumbia pa' que muevan, cumbia pa' que goce
Pa' bailarla por el día y después de las 12
Baila sabrocito, pero sin evitar choqué
...
Wie kann das sein?
Erst hast du dich verrannt und dann verkeilt
Trägst es rum und fühlst dich ganz allein
Warum machst du dich so klein? Frisst das alles in dich rein (in dich rein)
Ich erkenn dich nicht
Fühlst dich, als ob du im Gefängnis bist
Stehst vor 'nem Berg und siehst das Ende nicht
Hast du vergessen, wer du bist? Du warst mal Optimist
Bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
Bist du zu stolz und hast dich deshalb weggedreht?
Ich kam zurück und hab von Weitem schon geseh'n, dass du dich quälst
Sag, bist du okay?
Oder sind das in deinen Augen etwa Trän'n?
...
It was only you and I
But now I feel like I am trapped inside
A life that doesn't feel right
It's not me, it's not me
I thought you're my ride or die
But our love died on the ride
And we tried 'til it turned to lies
And you see, don't you see?
Yeah, no, we never gonna be like that
And I never gonna feel like that
You're looking over your shoulder, like I'ma hold ya back
Why you sound like such a grab?
When you said you quit on that
You don't know how it feels
Why you take my love just to rip it up?
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
Take my love just to rip it up
Guess for you it was not enough
All the best, good luck, now I'm tryna find someone new
Who's gonna love you better?
...
When the two of you walked in the other n-n-n-night
Saw you smilin' with your arms around his si-si-si-side
How I hate the hand in your hand wasn't m-m-m-mine
How I hate myself, I didn't treat you r-r-r-right
But I only want the best for you, trust me
Even if I know the best for you is not me
And the worst is I know I'm the reason why-why-why-why
You said goodbye-bye-bye-bye
He doesn't love you like I love you
He doesn't need you like I need you, no
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
He doesn't know you like I know you
'Cause baby, I know every part of you
He doesn't love you like I love you
Hope he won't hurt you like I hurt you
Guess I don't deserve you
Like I love you
Like I, like I love you, na-na-na
Like I love you
...
Sind Fragen da, hast du 'nen Plan
Planst du zu viel, bin ich spontan
Und machst du zu, geh ich offen damit um (damit um)
Flieg ich mal zu hoch, fängst du mich ein
Über mein'n Schatten springen wir zu zweit
Hätt nie gedacht, dass wir mal so weit komm'n
Oh, es kann so leicht sein, sich zu verlier'n
Doch bei dir weiß ich
Oh, du bleibst bei mir
Wer, wenn nicht wir?
Geh'n zusamm'n durch alle Zeiten
Was auch passiert, wir beide bleiben, wir bleiben
Sag mir, wo, wenn nicht hier?
Fangen wir an, zu begreifen
Dass die kleinen Dinge reichen?
Dass sie reichen mit dir
...
Ich denke viel zu oft an morgen
Wo will ich hin und wer will ich sein?
Ist meine Zukunft schon geschrieben?
Treff ich dich oder bleib ich doch allein?
Es sind die immer gleichen Fragen
Ich schlafe wieder mal nicht ein
Ey, find ich Liebe? Find ich Frieden?
Was ich weiß? Dass ich gar nichts weiß
Ich kann das Gestern und das Morgen eh nicht lenken
Also denk ich in Momenten
Die guten Zeiten, die sind jetzt
Ich hoff, dass du es nie vergisst
...
Passing every red light
I know I'm in over my head
A rebel and I don't hide
Remember all the words that you said
Even if the love was hurting
I'll be yours, I'll be yours again
I can feel that fire's burning
Give me more
So tell me, would you feel my love?
'Cause I can never get enough
So tell me, would you feel my love?
...
Y avait pas d'image, y avait pas d'couleur
Y avait pas d'histoire, mon âme sœur
Y avait pas les fêtes, y avait pas l'cœur
Aucun sourire, mon âme sœur
Tu sais le monde ne tournait pas rond
J'avais les mots mais pas la chanson
Tu sais l'amour, tu sais la passion
Oui, c'est écrit, c'était dit
Oui, c'est la vie
Avant toi, je n'avais rien
Avant toi, on n'm'a pas montré le chemin
Je sais, le Ciel ne m'en veut pas
D'avoir posé les yeux sur toi
...
Mes amis entendaient la vie que j'ai eu
Où les gens m'attendaient, je n'suis pas venu
Si je les emmêle, si je dérange
C'est qu'je suis un pêle-mêle, un mélange
J'suis trop compliqué
Je... n'choisirai jamais que les deux côtés
Ne... me demandez pas où je veux aller
Même les singes singent les sages
Et tous ces sages ont fait des cages
Où tous nous ranger
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye!
Aye, aye, aye!
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
Si je vous gêne
Bah c'est la même
...
Before you came around, I was doin' just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, I'm a wreck
And when I see you, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
...
Hi
Hi-hi, hi, hi-hi
Oh, oh, oh
Manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo, manedo
Mami oh, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh, mami, mami oh
Oh, le temps, le temps m'a réparé
Plus rien n'est comme avant, quelqu'un m'a déjà soigné
Oh, oh, le vent, le vent a bien tourné
Ne gaspille pas mon temps, une autre a su me soigner
Toi là, tu disparais sans laisser un mot
T'as préféré fuir comme un enfant (enfant)
Partir sans te retourner
J't'ai prêté mon cœur et tu lui as donné ton dos
Toi tu m'as fait gaspiller mon temps (mon temps)
Tu n'm'as pas laissé parler (ah, hi)
Et maintenant (maintenant)
...
Les mots me manquent
Pourtant j'aimerais crier
Muette saltimbanque à la gorge nouée
Et ça monte, ça monte, ça monte
Jusqu'à c'que mon petit cœur disjoncte
Et ça fait bim, bam, boum
Ça fait pshht et ça fait vroum
Ça fait bim, bam, boum
Dans ma tête y a tout qui tourne
Ça fait shht et puis blabla
Ça fait comme-ci, comme-ça
Ça fait bim, bam, ha ha ha
Dans mon cœur, je comprends pas
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
Ça fait bim, bam, là
Bim, bam, là
Ça fait bim, bam, quoi?
"I love you", je crois qu'c'est ça
...
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm riding, party with me
Party with me, I'm flyin', ridin' low-key
I'm ridin' low-key in style, rider, rider
...
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome when we're living our dream
Everything is better when we stick together
Side by side, you and I gonna win forever, let's party forever
We're the same, I'm like you, you're like me, we're all working in harmony
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool when you're part of a team
Everything is awesome when we're living our dream
3, 2, 1. Go
Have you heard the news, everyone's talking
Life is good 'cause everything's awesome
Lost my job, it's a new opportunity
More free time for my awesome community
...
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say?
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)
Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmh, whatcha say (Jason Derulo)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else
So no, I know I should have treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man
'Cause when the roof caved in, and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me, girl
Mmh, whatcha say
Mmh, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmh, whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmh, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmh, whatcha say
...
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're chilling with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all, mmm
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
...
The day I first met you
You told me, you'd never fall in love
And now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
Now here we are, so close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared
It's wrong like you might make a mistake
Theres just one life to live
And there's no time to waste (to waste)
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah
On Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cellphone, my love, but you did not reply
The world is ours if you want it
...
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
...
Turn it up
Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been singing in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these others got you losing control
You're like a gin to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life, in this good life you're a hard one to hold
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
Somebody save your soul 'cause you've been singing in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these others got you losing control
You're like a gin to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want your love and attention when I'm seeing you close
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
...
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before."
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
...
Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable!
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in!
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod!
When you're staring at a demigod
What can I say except you're welcome
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey!
What has two thumbs that pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yay high
This guy!
When the nights got cold
To stole you fire from down below
You're lookin' at him, yo
...
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can love me
Love me all day long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe
Where have you been
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah
Somewhere in the crowd?
Where have you been
All my life, all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
...
She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to know you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want
Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
...
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm bitin' on my tongue
And I, I keep stallin' and keepin' it together
People around gotta find somethin' to say now
Holdin' back everyday the same
Don't wanna be a loner
Listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
But with nothin' to consider they forget my name (ame, ame, ame)
They call me hell
They call me Stacey
They call me Her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me quiet
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
I'll miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last chick standing up against the wall
Keep fa-fallin', these heels that keep me borin'
Getting clamped up and sittin' on the fence now
So alone all the time and I lock myself away
Listen to me, oh no
And though I'm dressed up out and all
...
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small-talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
Turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
...
Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
...
Ooh boy your done
With me you say
All i hear is blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
Blah blah blah
All i hear is blah blah blah
Oh come or leave? i choose
Blah blah blah cause all i
Hear is blah blah blah
...
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous thoughts and getting lost
To staying up and stuck in night with you
But now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads is gonna bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
...
I was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who walks you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
...
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A wonderful, miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
...
If I told you, it was only gonna hurt
If I warned you, that the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk in?
Would you let me do it first?
Do it all in the name of love
Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?
In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?
In the name of love
Name of love
In the name of love
Name of love
In the name of—
...
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don't have to fall from grace
Put down the words you fight with
And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
We're runnin' out of time
Chasing our lies
Every day a small piece of you cries
...
You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I could forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
...
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment
Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed
It's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I
Ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you
But, I guess the more you
Thought about everything,
You were never even wrong in the first place, right?
Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you, with my head down,
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you
Very loyal?
Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
...
Ah, ah
Hey-ey
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
He knows
All the secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's love has touched my heart
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The message on her phone
She's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
Coming home, coming home
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Just lie to me there's no other (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know, I know, I know, I know (ah, ah)
...
You know I'm back like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (another step)
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I fly
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And yeah, I'm great, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
Legend, it's exodus, searching your glory, yeah
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20 thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
...
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I, I'm felling so small
It was over my head, I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
...
There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
...
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said sing me something
He said, if you dare sing a little louder
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
...
You shine like a star
You know who you are
You're everything beautiful
She's hot, hot like the sun
The loneliest one
Still everything beautiful
Well I'll be goddamned
You're standing by my door
We stayed up in the city
'Til the stars lost the war
So Friday night, holy ghost
Take me to your level
Show me the one I need the most
I need the most
I wish I knew you when I was young
...
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kind of boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time, don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
...
I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now, the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone home
Voices I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unknown place the only time I feel safe
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
...
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring bring a sword, bring your worse, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Now you ain't know your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
...
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone-cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah
I know you're choking on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love, ah, ah
...
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
...
Yo, tonight is the night that I'ma gonna fix it
Gimme a song and a voice, I'ma mix it
Like a spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time
The night is still young
...
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your 50-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel all right
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you have a doubt
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm going every second 'til it sees my soul
(Woo) I'll be running (woo), I'll be running
...
Levels, levels, levels, levels
Get on my elevator, baby we're going up
Give me that now and later, I can't get enough
So much to discover, please don't stop me now (don't stop me)
Every time I touch you, you lift right off the ground
Let them go, all the one's tryna get in the door
I'mma go where they all couldn't go
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh
I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up
(Rooftop)
(Up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up)
...
Okay
Game face
Here we go
I've got my life in disorder
My room's not in order
I'm in the way
I'm always late
I've got too many things to say
I rock mom jeans, cat earrings
Extrapolate my feelings
My family is dysfunctional
But we have a good time kidding each other
They tell us from the time we're young
To hide the things that we don't like about ourselves
Inside ourselves
...
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone, can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My gosh, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
...
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
...
Well, I came home
Like a stone
And I felt happy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
But I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
So break my step
And relent
...
Mr. Know-it-all
Well ya think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something y'all
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down another thing to swallow
Mr. Bring-me-down
Well ya, ya like to bring me down, don't you?
But I ain't laying down, baby, I ain't goin' down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody's gonna make a fool out of me
Baby, you should know that I lead not follow
Oh you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
...
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a put-down or a hug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
And they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
...
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been up when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day, you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely flies
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
...
Yeah
Yeah
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showing fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
I've been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showing fake love to me
Straight up to my face
Straight up to my face
Something ain't right when we talking
Something ain't right when we talking
Look like you hiding your problems
Really you never was all in
No you can't son me, you won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach, I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
...
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that color dress
Everything she never had she's searching for
Living too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
...
Hold, hold on, hold onto me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady
A little unsteady
Hold on, come here
Approach, appear
Hold on, I'm in love
'Cause this house don't feel like home
If you love me, don't let go (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whoa, if you love me, don't let go (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
...
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a dream and love's the one
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
Oh high, oh high, oh high
Got me flying
I'm still high, so high, so high
Oh high, oh high, oh high
Now I'm flying
...
When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
...
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving today
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart, yeah
Arrow, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and then some
How do we call this love? (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I tried, to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love? (whoa-oh-oh-oh)
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone when I say
All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
...
Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then, I love you now
Oh yeah
Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
Normally we hanging out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
...
Yeah, you can be the greatest
You can be the best
You can be the King Kong banging on your chest
You can beat the world
You can beat the war
You can talk to God, go banging on his door
You can throw your hands up
You can beat the clock (yeah)
You can move a mountain
You can break rocks
You can be a master
Don't wait for luck
Dedicate yourself and you gon' find yourself
Standing in the hall of fame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)
'Cause you burn with the brightest flame (yeah)
And the world's gonna know your name (yeah)
And you'll be on the walls of the hall of fame
You can go the distance
You can run the mile
You can walk straight through hell with a smile
You can be the hero
You can get the gold
...
This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other girl
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better yet
Hope she ain't falling you like I did, baby
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it
Guess I should say thank you
For the love yous and the bad news
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the mess
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now
Well, I, I'm all the way up
I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down
...
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving like 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Ask you once, ask you twice now
There's lipstick on your collar
You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her?
So you want to go on with someone to
Do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up, don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
That's a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done
...
I woke up with a fear this morning
But with the words still on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're on my mind and we've got air in our lungs
Last night, we were way up, talking in the back of the cab
And then you say, "Love, baby, let's go hang at the flat"
And when we dance, I never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
...
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an unexposed location, location
These dry eyes lookin' for the sun
Paradise, we live it, and we call it a vacation, vacation
You're painting me a dream that I
Wouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in
Over the hills and far away, a million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away, some place where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay
I got the keys to the universe so stay
With me, 'cause I got the keys, baby
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering "where'd it all go?"
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We coming home tonight
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
...
I'm not sure just what you heard
But I know a simple trick
You put both hands up clap them above
Do it do it just like this
I think I might have got the dancing sickness
Never ever had a fever like this
But where's the fun of being normal anywhere
Ok 5 4 3 2 1
I feel like turning it up
Breaking it down
Jump on my feet don't touch the ground
You got a voice you got a choice
Come on get loud let's make some noise
Sing it like
Oooooooooh oooooooooh
This is the time it's you and I
Let's get lalalala loud
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let it move you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
This feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
My love (My love)
My lover, lover, lover
I'm in paradise whenever I'm with you
My mind (My mind)
My m-m-m-m-mind
Well it's a paradise whenever I'm with you
Ride on (Ride on)
I will ride on down the road
I will find you, I will hold you, I'll be there
It's long (How long?)
Well it's a mighty long road but
I find you, I will hold you and I'll be there
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
...
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', so we turn it up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Right now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
When it's Friday night and the sun don't work the same
...
Some days, things just
Take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate
People tell me to elevate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try
But you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
...
I will always remember
The day you kissed my cheek
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (Ooh)
Mmm, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
...
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
...
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her
Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with takin the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
...
(Hey, hey)
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh, oh
I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
...
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so I will not go
Turn the lights off carry me home
Na na na na na na na na na na
...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms, yeah, c'mon
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together, while I figured it out
I only looked, but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for bein' there for me
(Incomprehensible), but I walked away
But you had faith strong enough
To move over and give me space
...
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
Yes I know, it's too late
...
Esta noche bailamos
Te doy toda mi vida
Quedate conmigo
Tonight we dance
I leave my life, in your hands
We take the floor
Nothing is forbidden anymore
Don't let the world dim my sight
Don't let a moment go by
Nothing can stop us tonight
Bailamos, let the rhythm take you over
Bailamos
Te quiero amor mio, bailamos
Gonna live this night forever
...
If tomorrow is judgment day (Sing Mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couln't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
...
Uh ow!
Uh huh, yeah-yeah
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got bein' right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist?
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains but have you got the touch?
Now don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh huh, yeah-yeah
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
...
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your
Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca
Woke up in New York City
...
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talkin' to you
It's so sad that you're leavin'
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one... ohhh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say,
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
What am I supposed to do,
...
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable in three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become
If you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
...
Yo, listen up! Here is the story
About a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees
Is just blue like him, inside and outside
Blue his house, with the blue little window
And a blue Corvette, and everything is blue for him
And himself, and everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (to listen, to listen...)
I'm blue
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
I'm blue
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di
...
Yeah, I like it when the girls
Stop by in the summer
Do you remember?
Do you remember
When we met, last summer?
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie & Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
Hip-hop mama, spic n span
Met you one summer
And it all began
You're the best girl
That I ever did see
The great Larry Byrd, jersey 33
When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote
A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you
I saw my name is Rich
You look like a girl
From Abercrombie & Fitch
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie & Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
...
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side
And said I'm angry
Five days since you laughed at me saying
Get that together come back and see me
Three days since the living room,
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish,
Although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi
Cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes
Big like Leann Rimes
Because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits
You try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinkin, achin shake
I like vanilla, It's the finest of the flavors
Gotta see the show,
Cause then you'll know
...
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine
I look at you, lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm gonna love you boy you are so fine
Angel of mine
How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
You came into my life sent from above
When I lost all hope you showed me love
I'm checkin' for ya boy you're right on time
Angel of mine
...
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you
Everywhere I go, people stop and they see
25 years old, my mother, please rest her soul (Lord have mercy)
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
Spread your love and fly (oh, me, oh, my)
Spread your love and fly (oh, me, fly)
...
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
...
They say, "Oh, my gosh, I see the way you shine"
"Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
Now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say
"Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"
I said, "Oh, my gosh, I see you walking by"
"Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes"
...
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (here we go, guys)
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, when, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop, so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
...
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helped us through the phase and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
...
Remember the words you told me
"Love me 'til the day I fly"
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name (mmm)
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push and you push and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
So I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh
Youngblood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next (next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so-
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to let him down again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
...
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
Now I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
...
Doh
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh (aw, ow)

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (hey)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
All of my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh-na-na
He didn't walk up with that, "How you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with
(But I can't without you)
I'm doin' forever in a minute
...
Are you guys ready for this one?
Alright, lemme hear you sing
I like it like that
Gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
Gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin'
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us KIDZ BOP, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe
...
This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love some other girl
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better yet
Hope she ain't falling you like I did, baby
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it
Guess I should say thank you for the love yous and the bad news
Oh baby, I'm cool, by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the mess
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I'm
I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never, you'll never bring me down
...
Here we go
I want everybody to sing along
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
Say we got no, no, no, no future at all
They wanna ke-ke-keep us out, can't hold us down anymore
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
When we hit the bottom, nothin' gon' stop us
Climb to the top with you
We could be the greatest ones who never made it
Yeah, I could be talking to you
They tryna hate, hate, hate, but we won't change
Change anything at all, oh
We're gonna ri-ri-ri-ri-rise 'til we fall
They think we're just dropouts (clap your hands everyone)
Living at our mom's house
Parents must be so proud
They know it all
No, they don't speak our language
...
One kiss is all it takes fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Come on, everyone, let's see you singing along
Let me see your hands
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me move you while the moon is still out (hey)
Something in you
Lit up Heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
Was that thunder?
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
...
'Cause we can't stop this
Yeah, woah, oh-woah, yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
Feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide, when I'm dancing, get close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good dancing here with you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I say to you, but you dance, dance, dance
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
...
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her
Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with takin the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
...
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes-Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat
...
I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh, my gosh
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get rocked
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov!
Look at her dancing, just dance along
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
Let's do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
'Cause I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
...
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel?
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blew from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Yeah, put under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite
The light and let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go
Oh, oh, oh
As you shoot across the sky
'Cause baby, you're a firework
...
I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way
I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where do you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
It's hard to look right
At you baby,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
And all the other boys,
Try to chase me,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
...
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
I'm gonna rock some tags, only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is really awesome
Now walk up to the club like "What up? I got a hit song"
I'm so pumped, I bought some clothes from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so so frosty
The people like "Hey, the guy on the marquee!"
Rolling in super deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like my baseball cleats
(Ewww) But hey, it was 99 cents
Bag it, poppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, wear it man, I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm super happy, that's a bargain, yeah
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, "Can I have his hand-me-downs?" (Thank you!)
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I stay up too late
Got nothin' in my brain
And that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat

Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
...
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
Spread your love and fly
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you
Everywhere I go, people stop and they see
25 years old, my mother, please rest her soul (Lord have mercy)
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
Spread your love and fly (oh, me, oh, my)
Spread your love and fly (oh, me, fly)
...
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your
Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca
Woke up in New York City
...
(Hey, hey)
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh, oh
I'm doin' this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
...
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' on a juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna act a little crazy (at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
California girls, we're unforgettable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
Sun-kissed beach, so hot, will melt your Popsicle
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
...
Kidz Bop, yeah man
So we back in the club
Get that bodies rocking from side to side, side, side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back, back to life
Hands up and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body, ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
...
Oh, yeah
Oh!
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs.
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
...
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
...
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got those dance moves that all the boys chase
All the right moves in all the right places
I see the magazine (ah-ah) working that Photoshop (ah-ah)
You know that it ain't real, c'mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (ah-ah), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says, "Don't let it keep you at home in your room at night"
(Don't do it, do it, uh, don't do it)
You know I won't be no stick figure fake plastic Barbie doll
...
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby

Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)

Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
...
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
走れ！走れ！走れ！
ずっとキミを同じ電車で見るたびに
いつからだろう僕のココロの中で
大きくなっていた想い
話しかけることも出来なくていつも
友達と一緒に喋ってるふりで
横目で見てた僕だけど
気付いたこの感情に
もう後悔なんてしたくない
僕は僕にウソついて
逃げたくもない
溢れ出しそうなキモチを
一つ残らず言葉に全部詰め込もう
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
...
Walk in the rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry milkshake state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
...
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can say whatever you want to me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
...
If I end up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back again
I just found out the only reason that you're here with me
Was to get back with someone other but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know I'm dreamin', I feel it in the air
Every hour, every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you see me
I know you don't love enough
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
...
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, it's a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teaching you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a babe, you a beast
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...
When I was 24 あの頃にはもう一層
人とは違う好きがわかってた
時には悩んで縮こまっても
In the pool 飛び込みたいよ
好きなものを
好きと言える今の自分が誇らしい
つまらない理由をつけてた
気分に今サヨナラ！
誰の為でもないから
I like it, baby, I like it
何を言われてもいいよ
I like it, baby, I like it
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
You say "I like it"
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
...
Good, good, feeling good
Feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
E-e-every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
E-e-everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
...
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day, hey
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
Here's to the ones that we got
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Mmm
Hey, yeah
Ah
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in my bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
...
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
Shouldn't be with you
Guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there singing
I'm just here thinking
About where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm-ah, yeah
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen
Still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happening
You're a bad thing (oh)
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
...
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, as long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
...
Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx, yeah
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it
Got a dance, but it's really on some street it
I'ma show you how to get it
It go right foot up, left foot, slide
Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy
Can't let this one slide, ayy
Don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance like I'm a Jackson
I could sing it with passion
It's a Thriller in the trap where we from
Baby, don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance I'm a Jackson
I could sing till satisfaction
And you know we out here every day with it
I'ma show you how to get it
...
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out, look at me
Get down, get down, get down, get down, look at me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal

Don't you agree?
You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it

Hurt my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time other
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say
What a man gotta pray
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"?
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
So what a man gotta do
What a man gotta prove
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh

Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita

Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
If you don't wanna see me (see me)
Did a full 180
Crazy, thinking about the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me?
Maybe, but look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away
You know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
...
There's a place out there
Made for us, made for us
It ain't up in space, it's right here
And I can't wait for tomorrow
'Cause you know that it's
Ours to take, got no time to waste
Only getting better from here
So let's get on the move, find that something new
I can see it crystal clear
All that I know is we're gonna make the world shine
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Watch how we glow when we're dancing under bright lights
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Nothing could be better than this
And now I feel you, I feel that we could never miss
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I know you, I know you, I know you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It hurts me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
...
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if it's on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of flying
I never felt so loved
I've been havin' dreams (ah)
Splashin' in a summer stream (ah)
...
You were the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back (come back)
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time, it's not like that
'Cause I know where your heart's at
I know you like to be alone but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Now I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start (who do you)
Just because you're lonely
...
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna, 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every thought of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
...
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the one you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, games, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a future with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so very far
That you would never ever see me again
Won't see your alligator tears
...
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
...
Oh
Oh
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Oh
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble, while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh
Oh
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
...
Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And maybe
Don't even wanna call you "baby"
Saw us getting older (older)
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (upstairs)
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognise I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare
Baby
...
Oh
I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
Your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
...
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it but
We build this right
So nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (tú eres lo que yo necesito)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Porque tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (nadie como yo pa' ti)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres perfecta (perfecta)
Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta
...
Yeh (yeah)
Yeh
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados
Que bailamos enrumbados
Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados
Que bailamos enrumbados
Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado
...
In diesem Haus, wo ich wohn
Hier ist alles so gewohnt
So zum Ärgern vertraut
Mann, jeder Tag ist so gleich
Ich zieh Runden durch mein' Teich
Ich will nur noch hier raus
Ich brauch mehr Platz und frischen Wind
Ich muss schnell woanders hin
Sonst wachs ich hier fest
Ich mach 'nen Kopfsprung durch die Tür
Ich lass alles hinter mir
Hab was Großes im Visier
Ich komm nie zurück zu mir
Es gibt nichts, was mich hält, au revoir
Vergesst, wer ich war
Vergesst meinen Nam'n
Es wird nie mehr sein, wie es war
Ich bin weg, au, au
Au, au, au revoir
...
La la la la la, ey
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Ich war in den Hills von L.A.
Zwischen den größten Legenden der Welt
Ich war am Hafen Marseilles
Aß den Fisch dort direkt aus der See
Ich war im Herzen Ugandas
Genoss die Wärme der Nächte Kampalas
Bin durch die Hügel gewandert
Auf dem irischen Wicklow bei Dublin
Und ich guck schon wieder auf mein Handy
Denn mein Kopf ist bei dir
Man, wann seh ich dich endlich?
Ich schick 'n Herz in rot zu dir
Es gibt 194 Länder, ich will jedes davon seh'n
Sechseinhalbtausend Sprachen, ich versuch sie zu versteh'n
Die ganze Welt voll Abenteuer, will so viel wie's geht erleb'n
Aber dich, Baby dich, nur dich, gibt's halt einmal für mich
...
'Ne ganz normale 50-Stunden-Woche
Heimkomm'n und erst mal für die Kleinen kochen
Ist für sie ja kein Problem
Weil die Kids für sie an erster Stelle steh'n
Sie fragt sich, wie's gelaufen wär
Ohne Kinder
Selber laufen lern
Aber ihr Tag lässt keine Pause zu
Sie will träumen, macht die Augen zu
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie woanders
Für den Moment, dort wo sie will
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie wer anders
Lässt alles los nur für das Gefühl
Dann geht sie barfuß in New York
Schwimmt alleine durch Alaska
Springt vor Bali über Board
...
Heute, morgen und übermorgen
Guck, wie weit wir's schon geschafft ha'm
Doch ich glaub', ist nur der Anfang
Keine Träne ist hier umsonst
Ich wein' vor Glück wegen dem, was kommt
Wenn du auch denkst, dass du's nicht mehr schaffst
Trag' ich uns zwei, nehm' dich huckepack
Wir müssen mit uns reden wie Dickschädel
Und wenn ich falle, wirst du mich heben
Hab' mir verboten zu glauben, dass es dich gibt
Doch jetzt kneif' ich meinen Arm, in dem du grad liegst
An deiner Seite will ich bleiben
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?
All day, I sing it with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
La la la la la, ey
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna, 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every thought of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
...
If I end up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back again
I just found out the only reason that you're here with me
Was to get back with someone other but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know I'm dreamin', I feel it in the air
Every hour, every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you see me
I know you don't love enough
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
...
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right

And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...

Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx, yeah
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it
Got a dance, but it's really on some street it
I'ma show you how to get it
It go right foot up, left foot, slide
Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy
Can't let this one slide, ayy
Don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance like I'm a Jackson
I could sing it with passion
It's a Thriller in the trap where we from
Baby, don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance I'm a Jackson
I could sing till satisfaction
And you know we out here every day with it
I'ma show you how to get it
...
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, as long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
...
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can say whatever you want to me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
...
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
...
Mmm
Hey, yeah
Ah
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in my bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
...
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, it's a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teaching you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a babe, you a beast
...
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
Shouldn't be with you
Guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there singing
I'm just here thinking
About where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm-ah, yeah
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen
Still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happening
You're a bad thing (oh)
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
...
Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And maybe
Don't even wanna call you "baby"
Saw us getting older (older)
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (upstairs)
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
Your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
...
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I know you, I know you, I know you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It hurts me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
...
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)
Al otro día volvemo' (oh, yeah)
Tú sabes cómo lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (of the night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (oh, yeah)
We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo
¡Ritmo!
No son ni Reebook ni son Nike (no)
Sin estilista, luzco fly (yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night

Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
...
Walk in the rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry milkshake state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you

Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

Good, good, feeling good
Feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
E-e-every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
E-e-everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
...
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day, hey
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
Here's to the ones that we got
...
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out, look at me
Get down, get down, get down, get down, look at me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
...
I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
Oh (yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Never been in love before
I don't wanna feel these feelings, yo
Once upon a time, I thought it though
I don't even wanna go no more
Got you something from the record store
Little bit of Kids Bop and you know
Tryna open up a little more
Sorry if my heart a little slow
I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love-impaired
...
Kidz bop kickin' this track (hey)
Ayy, panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
...
Hurt my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time other
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say
What a man gotta pray
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"?
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
So what a man gotta do
What a man gotta prove
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (mamacita)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (Mamacita)
Ella no le baja, nunca tumba
Siempre está lista pa' la rumba
Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
If you don't wanna see me (see me)
Did a full 180
Crazy, thinking about the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me?
Maybe, but look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away
You know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
...
There's a place out there
Made for us, made for us
It ain't up in space, it's right here
And I can't wait for tomorrow
'Cause you know that it's
Ours to take, got no time to waste
Only getting better from here
So let's get on the move, find that something new
I can see it crystal clear
All that I know is we're gonna make the world shine
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Watch how we glow when we're dancing under bright lights
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Nothing could be better than this
And now I feel you, I feel that we could never miss
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if it's on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of flying
I never felt so loved
I've been havin' dreams (ah)
Splashin' in a summer stream (ah)
...
You were the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back (come back)
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time, it's not like that
'Cause I know where your heart's at
I know you like to be alone but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Now I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start (who do you)
Just because you're lonely
...
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the one you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, games, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a future with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so very far
That you would never ever see me again
Won't see your alligator tears
...
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it but
We build this right
So nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito

Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta

Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados
Que bailamos enrumbados
Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado

笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
走れ！走れ！走れ！
ずっとキミを同じ電車で見るたびに
いつからだろう僕のココロの中で
大きくなっていた想い
話しかけることも出来なくていつも
友達と一緒に喋ってるふりで
横目で見てた僕だけど
気付いたこの感情に
もう後悔なんてしたくない
僕は僕にウソついて
逃げたくもない
溢れ出しそうなキモチを
一つ残らず言葉に全部詰め込もう
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
...
When I was 24 あの頃にはもう一層
人とは違う好きがわかってた
時には悩んで縮こまっても
In the pool 飛び込みたいよ
好きなものを
好きと言える今の自分が誇らしい
つまらない理由をつけてた
気分に今サヨナラ！
誰の為でもないから
I like it, baby, I like it
何を言われてもいいよ
I like it, baby, I like it
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
You say "I like it"
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
...
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)
Al otro día volvemo' (oh, yeah)
Tú sabes cómo lo hacemo', baby
(This is the rhythm of the night)
Baby, tonight's like fuego (of the night)
We 'bout to spend the dinero (oh, yeah)
We party to the extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo, extremo
¡Ritmo!
No son ni Reebook ni son Nike (no)
Sin estilista, luzco fly (yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
...
Walk in the rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry milkshake state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
...
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can say whatever you want to me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
...
If I end up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back again
I just found out the only reason that you're here with me
Was to get back with someone other but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know I'm dreamin', I feel it in the air
Every hour, every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you see me
I know you don't love enough
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
...
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, it's a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teaching you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a babe, you a beast
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...
Tu amiga, baby

Here's to the ones that we got
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Mmm
Hey, yeah
Ah
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in my bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)

I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
Shouldn't be with you
Guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there singing
I'm just here thinking
About where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm-ah, yeah
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen
Still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happening
You're a bad thing (oh)
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
...
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, as long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to

You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out, look at me
Get down, get down, get down, get down, look at me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)

But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
...
I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
Oh (yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Never been in love before
I don't wanna feel these feelings, yo
Once upon a time, I thought it though
I don't even wanna go no more
Got you something from the record store
Little bit of Kids Bop and you know
Tryna open up a little more
Sorry if my heart a little slow
I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love-impaired
...
Kidz bop kickin' this track (hey)
Ayy, panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
...
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?
All day, I sing it with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
...
Hurt my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time other
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say
What a man gotta pray
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"?
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
So what a man gotta do
What a man gotta prove
...
If you don't wanna see me (see me)
Did a full 180
Crazy, thinking about the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me?
Maybe, but look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away
You know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
...
There's a place out there
Made for us, made for us
It ain't up in space, it's right here
And I can't wait for tomorrow
'Cause you know that it's
Ours to take, got no time to waste
Only getting better from here
So let's get on the move, find that something new
I can see it crystal clear
All that I know is we're gonna make the world shine
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Watch how we glow when we're dancing under bright lights
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Nothing could be better than this
And now I feel you, I feel that we could never miss
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I know you, I know you, I know you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It hurts me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
...
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if it's on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of flying
I never felt so loved
I've been havin' dreams (ah)
Splashin' in a summer stream (ah)
...
You were the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back (come back)
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time, it's not like that
'Cause I know where your heart's at
I know you like to be alone but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Now I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start (who do you)
Just because you're lonely
...
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna, 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every thought of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
...
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the one you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, games, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a future with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so very far
That you would never ever see me again
Won't see your alligator tears
...
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
...
Oh
Oh
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Oh
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble, while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh
Oh
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
...
Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And maybe
Don't even wanna call you "baby"
Saw us getting older (older)
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (upstairs)
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognise I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare
Baby
...
Oh
I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
Your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
...
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it but
We build this right
So nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
In diesem Haus, wo ich wohn
Hier ist alles so gewohnt
So zum Ärgern vertraut
Mann, jeder Tag ist so gleich
Ich zieh Runden durch mein' Teich
Ich will nur noch hier raus
Ich brauch mehr Platz und frischen Wind
Ich muss schnell woanders hin
Sonst wachs ich hier fest
Ich mach 'nen Kopfsprung durch die Tür
Ich lass alles hinter mir
Hab was Großes im Visier
Ich komm nie zurück zu mir
Es gibt nichts, was mich hält, au revoir
Vergesst, wer ich war
Vergesst meinen Nam'n
Es wird nie mehr sein, wie es war
Ich bin weg, au, au
Au, au, au revoir
...
La la la la la, ey
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Ich war in den Hills von L.A.
Zwischen den größten Legenden der Welt
Ich war am Hafen Marseilles
Aß den Fisch dort direkt aus der See
Ich war im Herzen Ugandas
Genoss die Wärme der Nächte Kampalas
Bin durch die Hügel gewandert
Auf dem irischen Wicklow bei Dublin
Und ich guck schon wieder auf mein Handy
Denn mein Kopf ist bei dir
Man, wann seh ich dich endlich?
Ich schick 'n Herz in rot zu dir
Es gibt 194 Länder, ich will jedes davon seh'n
Sechseinhalbtausend Sprachen, ich versuch sie zu versteh'n
Die ganze Welt voll Abenteuer, will so viel wie's geht erleb'n
Aber dich, Baby dich, nur dich, gibt's halt einmal für mich
...
'Ne ganz normale 50-Stunden-Woche
Heimkomm'n und erst mal für die Kleinen kochen
Ist für sie ja kein Problem
Weil die Kids für sie an erster Stelle steh'n
Sie fragt sich, wie's gelaufen wär
Ohne Kinder
Selber laufen lern
Aber ihr Tag lässt keine Pause zu
Sie will träumen, macht die Augen zu
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie woanders
Für den Moment, dort wo sie will
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie wer anders
Lässt alles los nur für das Gefühl
Dann geht sie barfuß in New York
Schwimmt alleine durch Alaska
Springt vor Bali über Board
...
Heute, morgen und übermorgen
Guck, wie weit wir's schon geschafft ha'm
Doch ich glaub', ist nur der Anfang
Keine Träne ist hier umsonst
Ich wein' vor Glück wegen dem, was kommt
Wenn du auch denkst, dass du's nicht mehr schaffst
Trag' ich uns zwei, nehm' dich huckepack
Wir müssen mit uns reden wie Dickschädel
Und wenn ich falle, wirst du mich heben
Hab' mir verboten zu glauben, dass es dich gibt
Doch jetzt kneif' ich meinen Arm, in dem du grad liegst
An deiner Seite will ich bleiben
...
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
走れ！走れ！走れ！
ずっとキミを同じ電車で見るたびに
いつからだろう僕のココロの中で
大きくなっていた想い
話しかけることも出来なくていつも
友達と一緒に喋ってるふりで
横目で見てた僕だけど
気付いたこの感情に
もう後悔なんてしたくない
僕は僕にウソついて
逃げたくもない
溢れ出しそうなキモチを
一つ残らず言葉に全部詰め込もう
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
...
When I was 24 あの頃にはもう一層
人とは違う好きがわかってた
時には悩んで縮こまっても
In the pool 飛び込みたいよ
好きなものを
好きと言える今の自分が誇らしい
つまらない理由をつけてた
気分に今サヨナラ！
誰の為でもないから
I like it, baby, I like it
何を言われてもいいよ
I like it, baby, I like it
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
You say "I like it"
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
...
Walk in the rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry milkshake state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
...
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can say whatever you want to me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
...
If I end up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back again
I just found out the only reason that you're here with me
Was to get back with someone other but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know I'm dreamin', I feel it in the air
Every hour, every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you see me
I know you don't love enough
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
...
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, it's a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teaching you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a babe, you a beast
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...
Good, good, feeling good
Feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
E-e-every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
E-e-everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
...
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day, hey
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
Here's to the ones that we got
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
Mmm
Hey, yeah
Ah
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in my bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
...
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
Shouldn't be with you
Guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there singing
I'm just here thinking
About where I should've been
I've been lonely, mm-ah, yeah
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen
Still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'm a sad girl in this big world
It's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happening
You're a bad thing (oh)
I know I messed up, I'm a confuser
...
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, as long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
...
Black leather glove, no sequins
Buckles on the jacket, it's Alyx, yeah
Nike crossbody, got a piece in it
Got a dance, but it's really on some street it
I'ma show you how to get it
It go right foot up, left foot, slide
Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy
Can't let this one slide, ayy
Don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance like I'm a Jackson
I could sing it with passion
It's a Thriller in the trap where we from
Baby, don't you wanna dance with me? No?
I could dance I'm a Jackson
I could sing till satisfaction
And you know we out here every day with it
I'ma show you how to get it
...
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out, look at me
Get down, get down, get down, get down, look at me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
...
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
...
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
Toda la noche rompemo' (of the night)

No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (na')
Si los perdí, tengo claro que e' mi culpa (es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi Oasis y la paz no me la tumban (wuh)
Hakuna Matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters lo' retumban, nosotros pa' la rumba (ra)
This is the rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm of the night
...
I'm cryin' 'cause I love you
Oh (yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Never been in love before
I don't wanna feel these feelings, yo
Once upon a time, I thought it though
I don't even wanna go no more
Got you something from the record store
Little bit of Kids Bop and you know
Tryna open up a little more
Sorry if my heart a little slow
I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love-impaired
...
Kidz bop kickin' this track (hey)
Ayy, panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied
...
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?
All day, I sing it with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
...
Hurt my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time other
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say
What a man gotta pray
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"?
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
So what a man gotta do
What a man gotta prove
...
Baby, ven conmigo, ven conmigo, baila (baila)
La música e' testigo, ya la veo, mamacita
Louis Vuitton e' su vestido (su vestido)
Diamante', le gusta cuando al oído yo le digo, eh, eh
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (mamacita)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah, uh-ah-ah (eh-oh, eh-oh)
Mamacita, mamacita
Qué bonita (Mamacita)
Ella no le baja, nunca tumba
Siempre está lista pa' la rumba
Tu' amiga' que le secundan
Salen y gastan la funda
Le gusta sudar sin control
Sola la pasa mejor
Vestía' de Christian Dior
Siempre llega cuando sale el sol
Dame de lo que yo sé
Una doncella, lo sé
Que la shorty tiene sed
Ese paso, mami, la rompe
...
If you don't wanna see me (see me)
Did a full 180
Crazy, thinking about the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me?
Maybe, but look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away
You know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
...
There's a place out there
Made for us, made for us
It ain't up in space, it's right here
And I can't wait for tomorrow
'Cause you know that it's
Ours to take, got no time to waste
Only getting better from here
So let's get on the move, find that something new
I can see it crystal clear
All that I know is we're gonna make the world shine
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Watch how we glow when we're dancing under bright lights
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Nothing could be better than this
And now I feel you, I feel that we could never miss
...
They say oh my gosh I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me oh oh oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me ay ay ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
I said oh my gosh I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
...
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I know you, I know you, I know you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It hurts me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
...
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if it's on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of flying
I never felt so loved
I've been havin' dreams (ah)
Splashin' in a summer stream (ah)
...
You were the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back (come back)
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time, it's not like that
'Cause I know where your heart's at
I know you like to be alone but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Now I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start (who do you)
Just because you're lonely
...
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna, 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every thought of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
...
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the one you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, games, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a future with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so very far
That you would never ever see me again
Won't see your alligator tears
...
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to know these lonely nights
I love you, baby
Trust in me when I say
I love you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I you
I-I-I-I you, you
I-I-I
I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right
...
Oh
Oh
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Oh
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble, while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh
Oh
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
...
Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And maybe
Don't even wanna call you "baby"
Saw us getting older (older)
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (upstairs)
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognise I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special, yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare
Baby
...
Oh
I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
Your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
...
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it but
We build this right
So nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Tu amiga, baby
No sé si te lo han dicho antes
Pero después de haber comido en tanto' restaurantes (mmm)
Los más caros, más ricos, más finos y más elegantes (yeh)
Después de viajar por los sitios más extravagantes, descubrí, yeh
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tu sonrisa es mi lugar favorito
Y tus ojos mi mirada favorita
Porque tú eres lo que yo necesito
Porque yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (tú eres lo que yo necesito)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Porque tú eres lo que yo, tú eres lo que yo necesito (nadie como yo pa' ti)
Y yo soy lo que tú, y yo soy lo que tú necesitas
Tú eres perfecta (perfecta)
Siempre dispuesta, amorosa y contenta
...
Yeh (yeah)
Yeh
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados
Que bailamos enrumbados
Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado (eh)
Pero pusieron la canción
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Que cantamos enrumbados
Que bailamos enrumbados
Nos miramos, nos amamos los dos
Pensaba que te había olvidado
...
In diesem Haus, wo ich wohn
Hier ist alles so gewohnt
So zum Ärgern vertraut
Mann, jeder Tag ist so gleich
Ich zieh Runden durch mein' Teich
Ich will nur noch hier raus
Ich brauch mehr Platz und frischen Wind
Ich muss schnell woanders hin
Sonst wachs ich hier fest
Ich mach 'nen Kopfsprung durch die Tür
Ich lass alles hinter mir
Hab was Großes im Visier
Ich komm nie zurück zu mir
Es gibt nichts, was mich hält, au revoir
Vergesst, wer ich war
Vergesst meinen Nam'n
Es wird nie mehr sein, wie es war
Ich bin weg, au, au
Au, au, au revoir
...
La la la la la, ey
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Ich war in den Hills von L.A.
Zwischen den größten Legenden der Welt
Ich war am Hafen Marseilles
Aß den Fisch dort direkt aus der See
Ich war im Herzen Ugandas
Genoss die Wärme der Nächte Kampalas
Bin durch die Hügel gewandert
Auf dem irischen Wicklow bei Dublin
Und ich guck schon wieder auf mein Handy
Denn mein Kopf ist bei dir
Man, wann seh ich dich endlich?
Ich schick 'n Herz in rot zu dir
Es gibt 194 Länder, ich will jedes davon seh'n
Sechseinhalbtausend Sprachen, ich versuch sie zu versteh'n
Die ganze Welt voll Abenteuer, will so viel wie's geht erleb'n
Aber dich, Baby dich, nur dich, gibt's halt einmal für mich
...
'Ne ganz normale 50-Stunden-Woche
Heimkomm'n und erst mal für die Kleinen kochen
Ist für sie ja kein Problem
Weil die Kids für sie an erster Stelle steh'n
Sie fragt sich, wie's gelaufen wär
Ohne Kinder
Selber laufen lern
Aber ihr Tag lässt keine Pause zu
Sie will träumen, macht die Augen zu
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie woanders
Für den Moment, dort wo sie will
Und wenn sie tanzt, ist sie wer anders
Lässt alles los nur für das Gefühl
Dann geht sie barfuß in New York
Schwimmt alleine durch Alaska
Springt vor Bali über Board
...
Heute, morgen und übermorgen
Guck, wie weit wir's schon geschafft ha'm
Doch ich glaub', ist nur der Anfang
Keine Träne ist hier umsonst
Ich wein' vor Glück wegen dem, was kommt
Wenn du auch denkst, dass du's nicht mehr schaffst
Trag' ich uns zwei, nehm' dich huckepack
Wir müssen mit uns reden wie Dickschädel
Und wenn ich falle, wirst du mich heben
Hab' mir verboten zu glauben, dass es dich gibt
Doch jetzt kneif' ich meinen Arm, in dem du grad liegst
An deiner Seite will ich bleiben
...
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
走れ！走れ！走れ！
ずっとキミを同じ電車で見るたびに
いつからだろう僕のココロの中で
大きくなっていた想い
話しかけることも出来なくていつも
友達と一緒に喋ってるふりで
横目で見てた僕だけど
気付いたこの感情に
もう後悔なんてしたくない
僕は僕にウソついて
逃げたくもない
溢れ出しそうなキモチを
一つ残らず言葉に全部詰め込もう
笑顔が止まらない
踊るココロ止まらない
動き出すよ君の元へ
...
When I was 24 あの頃にはもう一層
人とは違う好きがわかってた
時には悩んで縮こまっても
In the pool 飛び込みたいよ
好きなものを
好きと言える今の自分が誇らしい
つまらない理由をつけてた
気分に今サヨナラ！
誰の為でもないから
I like it, baby, I like it
何を言われてもいいよ
I like it, baby, I like it
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
You say "I like it"
Do you wanna dance with me?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it)
...
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to live, maybe
I'm going through it all
You don't even have to say too much
You can say it all with just a song, baby
I look around and
This city's cold and empty (ah)
No one's around to judge me (ah)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, "Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights"
No, I can't sleep 'cause you know I think too much
...
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
Didn't like to know it, keep with me in the moment
I'd say it had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused, you know it? Say so
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
...
If I end up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' first
You got a way of keeping me comin' back again
I just found out the only reason that you're here with me
Was to get back with someone other but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know I'm dreamin', I feel it in the air
Every hour, every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you see me
I know you don't love enough
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...
Walk in the rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry milkshake state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine
Honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Oh, honey
I'd walk through fire for you
Just let me adore you
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
...
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can say whatever you want to me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
...
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I know you, I know you, I know you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It hurts me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
...
You were the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back (come back)
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time, it's not like that
'Cause I know where your heart's at
I know you like to be alone but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Now I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start (who do you)
Just because you're lonely
...
Mmm
Hey, yeah
Ah
I'm not one to stick around
One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in my bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
...
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feelin' diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?
All day, I sing it with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (come on), come on (come on), come on
Let's get physical
...
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
There's a time that I remember
When I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever
And everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December
When somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you
But I know I will one day, hey
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
Here's to the ones that we got
...
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Fallin' for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life
So tell me if you wanna, 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it 'cause I can't believe it
With every thought of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away
And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
...
Hurt my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time other
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say
What a man gotta pray
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"?
So, what a man gotta do
What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
So what a man gotta do
What a man gotta prove
...
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would say their name and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (oh, oh, oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be better than yours
...
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the one you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, games, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a future with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so very far
That you would never ever see me again
Won't see your alligator tears
...
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out, look at me
Get down, get down, get down, get down, look at me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
...
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, it's a thriller
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for teaching you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a babe, you a beast
...
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, as long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
...

If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love

Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer day in June)
And then says he got love within him (ay)
He got me feelin' like
Oooh
I knew it when I met him
...
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-c'mon
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got those dance moves that all the boys chase
All the right moves in all the right places
I see the magazine (ah-ah) working that Photoshop (ah-ah)
You know that it ain't real, c'mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (ah-ah), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says, "Don't let it keep you at home in your room at night"
(Don't do it, do it, uh, don't do it)
You know I won't be no stick figure fake plastic Barbie doll

...
Yeah, KB, baby
I buy you somethin' cost more than a penny
Gotta be real with it
Yeah
Kiki, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and throw me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to stoppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby
...
We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But no, I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there
Even when I try
You don't believe it
We do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
...
There's a place out there
Made for us, made for us
It ain't up in space, it's right here
And I can't wait for tomorrow
'Cause you know that it's
Ours to take, got no time to waste
Only getting better from here
So let's get on the move, find that something new
I can see it crystal clear
All that I know is we're gonna make the world shine
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Watch how we glow when we're dancing under bright lights
Got the vision, 2020 vision
Nothing could be better than this
And now I feel you, I feel that we could never miss
...
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You went off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
...
Ayy, ayy
I don't want this night to end
It's closing time, so leave with me again (Yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a day where happiness begins
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dance to an '80s groove (Ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dance
It's only human, you know that it's real
...
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin' (Yeah)
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin' (What?)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Yeah)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us Kidz Bop, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
They dancing on top of the roof
Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
...
I'm curious about you,
So how's your day?
Oh tell me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah,
Oh Yeah Ah Yeah
What makes you happy instead of okay
Oh Text me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Your every picture
I want them all under my pillow
Oh Bae
Come be my teacher
I wanna know all about you
Your 1, Your 2
Listen my my baby I am
Flying high in the sky cause I'm with you
You know i can fly
Cause you gave me my wings
Now we are above it all
I want your eyes locked on mine
For the future
Yeah I'm making you a boy with luv
Oh my my my Oh my my my

Looking for something right
Didn't understand but I can't deny

Ohohoh I have waited longer
Ohohoh for a boy with
...
Kidz Bop music!
Haha, let's go
Haha, Kidz Bop, uh
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby, it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high (Put 'em high)
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Both arms, yeah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high
Put 'em up
Mama told you don't talk to strangers (Mama, mama)
But when you're ridin' in the drop, you can't explain it
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
We'll make you feel it outta your mind (Ooh)
...
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving like 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
...
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
...
When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate
Then we'll find a way to cheat
'Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair
You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
...
Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I fly
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push, and you push, and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give, and I give, and I give, and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
...
Yeah, hmm
Ah yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, dancing here with you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I saying to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
I've been stuck in motion
Moving too fast
Tryna catch a moment but it slips through my hands
All I see are long days and dark nights
I'm lost without you, but I'm on my way, so hold tight
I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my gosh, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the sparks to fly
Into the morning
Oh my gosh, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
Don't wanna spend my whole life catching my breath
...
Hey Kids, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Hey, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh, look out!
Kidz Bop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer things (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues
Ooh yeah
I'm a dangerous one with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty ones around me and they know just how to talk it (Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
...
I saw you came along
I felt me something strong
The room was kinda hazy
Been overthinking lately
And then you turned around
I looked you up and down
Just ask my heart about it
It's goin' crazy, I'm...
Sending all these vibes to you
I'm a lonely one, got my aim on you
I'm lucky that my wish came true
It turns out, that you are coming through
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
All these vibes
I wanna be your one and only
So I'm sending you these vibes
All these vibes
...
Ey, ey, ey-yeah-ha
Hey, hey, yeah, ey
Ich hab mich irgendwie verlaufen
Hab kein'n Plan, wohin ich geh
Steh mit meinem kleinen Koffer
Hier auf der Champs-Élysées
Auf einmal sprichst du mich an
"Salut, qu'est-ce que vous cherchez?"
Ich sag', "Pardon, es tut mir leid
Ich kann dich leider nicht versteh'n"
Doch du redest immer weiter
Ich find's irgendwie charmant
Und male zwei Tassen Kakao
Mit 'nem Stift auf deine Hand
Je ne parle pas français
Aber bitte red weiter
Alles, was du so erzählst
Hört sich irgendwie nice an
Und die Zeit bleibt einfach steh'n
Ich wünscht, ich könnte dich versteh'n
Je ne parle pas français
...
In diesem Haus, wo ich wohn
Hier ist alles so gewohnt
So zum Ärgern vertraut
Mann, jeder Tag ist so gleich
Ich zieh Runden durch mein' Teich
Ich will nur noch hier raus
Ich brauch mehr Platz und frischen Wind
Ich muss schnell woanders hin
Sonst wachs ich hier fest
Ich mach 'nen Kopfsprung durch die Tür
Ich lass alles hinter mir
Hab was Großes im Visier
Ich komm nie zurück zu mir
Es gibt nichts, was mich hält, au revoir
Vergesst, wer ich war
Vergesst meinen Nam'n
Es wird nie mehr sein, wie es war
Ich bin weg, au, au
Au, au, au revoir
...
Da wo ich herkomm wohnen eintausend Menschen
Im Ort daneben schon zweimal so viel
Dreihunderttausend in der nächsten Großstadt
Und bald vier Millionen in Berlin
Ich war die letzten fünf Jahre alleine
Hab nach dem Sechser im Lotto gesucht
Sieben Nächte die Woche zu wenig gepennt
Wie auf 'ner Achterbahn im Dauerflug
So weit gekommen und so viel gesehen
So viel passiert, dass wir nicht verstehen
Ich weiß es nicht, doch ich frag es mich schon
Wie hast du mich gefunden? (Gefunden)
Einer von 80 Millionen
De-de-op
De-de-op-oh
De-de-op oooh
Hier war das Ufer unserer Begegnung
...
Die Leute fragen: "Wie viel Extrameter gehst du?"
Ich fang erst an zu zählen, wenn es weh tut
Fehler prägen mich, mach mehr als genug
Bin zu müde für Pausen, komm nicht dazu
Und wenn ich glaube, meine Beine sind zu schwer
Dann geh ich nochmal tausend Schritte mehr
Auch wenn wir schon weit gekommen sind
Wir geh'n immer weiter hoch hinaus
Egal, wie hoch die Hürden auch sind
Sie seh'n so viel kleiner von hier oben aus
Wenn dir die Luft ausgeht
Nur nicht nach unten seh'n
...
Wer friert uns diesen Moment ein?
Besser kann es nicht sein
Denkt an die Tage, die hinter uns liegen
Wie lang wir Freude und Tränen schon teil'n
Hier geht jeder für jeden durchs Feuer
Im Regen steh'n wir niemals allein
Und solange unsre Herzen uns steuern
Wird das auch immer so sein
Ein Hoch auf das, was vor uns liegt
Dass es das Beste für uns gibt
Ein Hoch auf das, was uns vereint
Auf diese Zeit (auf diese Zeit)
Ein Hoch auf uns (uns)
Auf dieses Leben
Auf den Moment
Der immer bleibt
Ein Hoch auf uns (uns)
Auf jetzt und ewig
Auf einen Tag
Unendlichkeit
...
Kidz Bop
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí (Jaja)
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready (Hey)
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
Con-con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
E' una asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
I like your dance moves, girl
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
Tiene adrenalina, en medio 'e la pista, ahí ella baila lo que sea
I like your dance moves, girl
Ya vi que estás solita, acompáñame
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
Ella casi ni sale, la traicionó el amor
Tiene par de amistades, pero no quiere relación
Donde va sobresale, en sus ojos se ve la ilusión
Pero llamó a su amiga, que se olvide, que esta es su canción
Y baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa' que esto no pare (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila
Tengo que contarte ante' que esto acabe (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa' que este no pare (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila
Tengo que contarte ante' que se acabe
Me gusta como te ves (Te ve'-e'-e')
Moviéndote, así es (Así e'-e')
Dejando la timidez (Woh, oh)
Me gusta' demasia'o, aquí me tienes admirándote (Admirándote)
Todo el tiempo imaginándote-e (Imaginándote)
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
Kidz Bop, bebé-bé
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, todos están pendiente' a ti (Wuh)
Pero tú puesta pa' mí (Ajá)
Haciendo que me odien más (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Porque todos te quieren mirar (Ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren mirar (Ja)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (Trr; yeah, yeah)
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo lo repetía
Yeah, dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo lo repetía
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Bebé, yo soy fan de ti al cantar (Wuh)
Te doy todo lo mío, hasta mi respirar (Yeah)
Contigo veo todo como en espiral (Yeah)
...
Esto vamo' a arrancarlo con altura
El dembow lo canto con hondura
Dicen una estrella, una figura
De Héctor aprendí la sabrosura
Nunca viste una joya tan pura
Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura
(Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo rápido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)
Iré joven pa' la sepultura
(Con altura)
Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura
(Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo rápido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)
Iré joven pa' la sepultura
(Con altura)
Pongo rosas sobre el Panamera
Pongo palmas sobre la guantanamera
Llevo a Camarón en la guantera (De la Isla)
Lo hago para mi gente y lo hago a mi manera
Flores azules y quilates
Y si es mentira que me maten
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Oh-woh
¿Qué pasa, Kidz Bop?
Hmm, jejeje
Hey, yeah (Ay)
Tengo en esta historia algo que confesar
Ya entendí muy bien qué fue lo que pasó
Y aunque duela tanto tengo que aceptar
Que tú no eres la mala, que el malo soy yo
No me conociste nunca de verdad
Ya se fue la magia que te enamoró
Y es que no quisiera estar en tu lugar
Porque tu error sólo fue conocerme
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (Soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir
Es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (Así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (Soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir
Es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (Así)
Échame la culpa (Okay)
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Desconocidos
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Kidz Bop
Apenas somos dos desconocidos (Yeah)
Con ganas de mirarse
Con ganas de que pase lo que pase
Apenas somos dos (Yeah; apenas somos dos)
Desconocidos (Oh-oh)
Con miedo a enamorarse
Con miedo de que pase lo que pase
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Wuh)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, no la bailamos
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato (Sí)
Si quieres, después nos enamoramos (Mhm)
Vamo' a pasar un buen rato
Paso a paso, no la bailamos
(Mhm)
Oye, oye, óyeme bien
Tú sabes lo que busco en vez de pretender
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is
...
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'ma 100% that kid
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got some problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a good friend, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New ones, like the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
...
Cuatro abrazos y un café, apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano, de todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Pa' sentir la arena en los pies
...
Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones
Or grab your dance partner
And if you're by yourself, no worries
Just follow after me (Yeah)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Go'n throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back, put your hips in it
(Woo-hoo-hoo)
Let's have some fun (Uh)
To the left, to the left now (To the left, to the left)
To the right, to the right (To the right)
Now take your left hand and (Uh)
Put it on your side (Put it on your side)
Go and roll your shoulders (Roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (Do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part, uh
'Cause it's time to shine (Woo)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
...
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took another look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna hear how you sing (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't throw it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Yeah, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
We could hang out in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, my heart's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
These things always happen to me (Yeah)
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
You're so damn beautiful
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
...
All my life, been working and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a singer sellin' songs and I'm on a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and all the traders
So, I sang my song, get up and leave
I climb and I'm the bravest, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
I wanna go home
Party
Trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me's fallin' in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it
Taking the shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong
So I hold on
...
Yeah
Found someone's name in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even know
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you know I knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flippin' on me, say I think too much
You're actin' different when we're talking, love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy (hey)
Where you been leavin'? (Hey)
You been keepin' me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love? (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Woah)
...
I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
...
I'm losing myself control
Yeah, you start and i trickle back in
But i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart i won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
I guess i could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain cause i can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But i guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and i
Can't keep going back i guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again
...
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
...
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both bug everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me (Woo)
...
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I met you late night at a party
Some trust fund baby's brooklyn loft
By the bathroom you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and that's when she said
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
...
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
...
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freak
Baby, come bring me help
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, you to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, that'll make it all right, yeah
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
Woah, yeah
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your music starts my heart, oh
Mess it up and make it just go crazy
I'm living for the song that you just made me love
I'm dreaming for the dancing on the daily
You're the only one that I want (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Break my heart, but don't tell me
I'm not doin' fine, 'cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine, but I'll do it fine
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'—?

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek, and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
...
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons you'll say that i need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me so i put it in this song
They tell me think with my head not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that i want if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And i say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll tell them a story they'll sit and nod their hands
...
It's sad, we're not together
But I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever
Love don't always make it through
Sometimes even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, but found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
...
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know (ooh oh)
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe
...
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
I should be saving up, but
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
And it feels like every day's a holiday
So I can't take my cheque to the bank
And I know, know, know I should be worried
But I work, work, work to the bone, baby
So gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Woo)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Hey)
Gimme that money
I said, now, gimme that money
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
...
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...

For the future

No, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time

Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger

Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up

Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is

This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
And we lived a life of pretty lies
You know it, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
...
It's sad, we're not together
But I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever
Love don't always make it through

I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can compare though
And for that I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the night will come
Until you're done with running, I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made up my mind
And I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
You're always there to remind me
You take me there
When waters rough, you will still be there
Without your love
You're always there right beside me
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
...
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
I wanna go home
Party
Trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me's fallin' in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it
Taking the shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong
So I hold on
...
I'm losing myself control
Yeah, you start and i trickle back in
But i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart i won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
I guess i could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain cause i can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But i guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and i
Can't keep going back i guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again
...
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took another look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna hear how you sing (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't throw it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Yeah, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
We could hang out in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, my heart's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
These things always happen to me (Yeah)
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'ma 100% that kid
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got some problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a good friend, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New ones, like the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
...
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
You're so damn beautiful
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
...
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
...
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both bug everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me (Woo)
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
Yeah
Found someone's name in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even know
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you know I knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flippin' on me, say I think too much
You're actin' different when we're talking, love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy (hey)
Where you been leavin'? (Hey)
You been keepin' me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love? (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Woah)
...
I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek, and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
...
I'm curious about you,
So how's your day?
Oh tell me

Listen my my baby I am
Flying high in the sky cause I'm with you
You know i can fly
Cause you gave me my wings
Now we are above it all
I want your eyes locked on mine
For the future
Yeah I'm making you a boy with luv
Oh my my my Oh my my my

I don't ever wanna leave your side
Oh my my my Oh my my my
Looking for something right
Didn't understand but I can't deny
Ohohoh I want something stronger
Ohohoh
Than a moment
Than a moment, love
Ohohoh I have waited longer
Ohohoh for a boy with
...
All my life, been working and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a singer sellin' songs and I'm on a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and all the traders
So, I sang my song, get up and leave
I climb and I'm the bravest, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
...
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
...
Dont you know I'm no good for you
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
I tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothing ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
...
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freak
Baby, come bring me help
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, you to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, that'll make it all right, yeah
...
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons you'll say that i need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me so i put it in this song
They tell me think with my head not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that i want if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And i say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll tell them a story they'll sit and nod their hands
...
Woah, yeah
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your music starts my heart, oh
Mess it up and make it just go crazy
I'm living for the song that you just made me love
I'm dreaming for the dancing on the daily
You're the only one that I want (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Break my heart, but don't tell me
I'm not doin' fine, 'cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine, but I'll do it fine
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'—?
...
No, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
...
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I met you late night at a party
Some trust fund baby's brooklyn loft
By the bathroom you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and that's when she said
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
...
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know (ooh oh)
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe
...
Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones
Or grab your dance partner
And if you're by yourself, no worries
Just follow after me (Yeah)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Go'n throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back, put your hips in it
(Woo-hoo-hoo)
Let's have some fun (Uh)
To the left, to the left now (To the left, to the left)
To the right, to the right (To the right)
Now take your left hand and (Uh)
Put it on your side (Put it on your side)
Go and roll your shoulders (Roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (Do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part, uh
'Cause it's time to shine (Woo)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
...
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more
Wasted energy, spent in a place where every
Hour awake I need an escape to center me
And I don't mean to make a rush for the door
But time's a currency, I'm currently poor
I'll be leavin' here soon, I don't mean to be rude, but
This scene ain't it for me, like your mum watchin' the news
I've got places I'd rather be and wantin' to see
Stoppin' to breathe is so hard around these oxygen thieves
I ain't waitin' around for all my days to amount
To less than average, shed the baggage that is weighin' me down
You can take my pride, money, and leverage that
But you takin' my time is somethin' I'll never get back
And you bet that I'ma jet, do a runner
Got a lot of regrets, won't let you be another
So I'ma exit casually, do a stealth
Before I'm the next casualty of myself
Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
...
Save it X the date on the wall
Hope you can make it
Tell your friends that they can come
Oh don't you worry everything gon' be great. Well worth the wait
Mmmmm
Walk in the room cover
Up your eyes
I know you wanna a big surprise
And make a wish for whatever you like one two, one two three four
We just here to say happy birthday
Birthday, 24 hours to celebrate
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more
I'm sick of us not doin' this right
That's why I think I'm cuttin' you from my life, no more

Everybody say hi
Look who's finally arrived
I'm not lookin' for a good time
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
You're so damn beautiful
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
...
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Yeah
Found someone's name in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even know
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you know I knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flippin' on me, say I think too much
You're actin' different when we're talking, love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy (hey)
Where you been leavin'? (Hey)
You been keepin' me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love? (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Woah)
...
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
...
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both bug everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me (Woo)
...
I'm losing myself control
Yeah, you start and i trickle back in
But i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart i won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
I guess i could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain cause i can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But i guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and i
Can't keep going back i guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again
...
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took another look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna hear how you sing (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't throw it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Yeah, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
We could hang out in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, my heart's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
These things always happen to me (Yeah)
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
All my life, been working and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a singer sellin' songs and I'm on a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and all the traders
So, I sang my song, get up and leave
I climb and I'm the bravest, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
...
Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones
Or grab your dance partner
And if you're by yourself, no worries
Just follow after me (Yeah)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Go'n throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back, put your hips in it
(Woo-hoo-hoo)
Let's have some fun (Uh)
To the left, to the left now (To the left, to the left)
To the right, to the right (To the right)
Now take your left hand and (Uh)
Put it on your side (Put it on your side)
Go and roll your shoulders (Roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (Do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part, uh
'Cause it's time to shine (Woo)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
...
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
I wanna go home
Party
Trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me's fallin' in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it
Taking the shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong
So I hold on
...
It's sad, we're not together
But I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever
Love don't always make it through
Sometimes even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, but found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
I'm curious about you,
So how's your day?
Oh tell me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah,
Oh Yeah Ah Yeah
What makes you happy instead of okay
Oh Text me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Your every picture
I want them all under my pillow
Oh Bae
Come be my teacher
I wanna know all about you
Your 1, Your 2
Listen my my baby I am
Flying high in the sky cause I'm with you
You know i can fly
Cause you gave me my wings
Now we are above it all
I want your eyes locked on mine
For the future
Yeah I'm making you a boy with luv
Oh my my my Oh my my my
I've waited all my life
I don't ever wanna leave your side
Oh my my my Oh my my my
Looking for something right
Didn't understand but I can't deny
Ohohoh I want something stronger

...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
...
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freak
Baby, come bring me help
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, you to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, that'll make it all right, yeah
...
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek, and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
...
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons you'll say that i need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me so i put it in this song
They tell me think with my head not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that i want if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And i say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll tell them a story they'll sit and nod their hands
...
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I met you late night at a party
Some trust fund baby's brooklyn loft
By the bathroom you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and that's when she said
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
...
Dont you know I'm no good for you
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
I tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothing ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
...
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
I should be saving up, but
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
And it feels like every day's a holiday
So I can't take my cheque to the bank
And I know, know, know I should be worried
But I work, work, work to the bone, baby
So gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Woo)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Hey)
Gimme that money
I said, now, gimme that money
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
...
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'ma 100% that kid
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got some problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a good friend, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New ones, like the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
...
Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the night will come
Until you're done with running, I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made up my mind
And I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
You're always there to remind me
You take me there
When waters rough, you will still be there
Without your love
You're always there right beside me
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
Woah, yeah
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your music starts my heart, oh
Mess it up and make it just go crazy
I'm living for the song that you just made me love
I'm dreaming for the dancing on the daily
You're the only one that I want (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Break my heart, but don't tell me
I'm not doin' fine, 'cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine, but I'll do it fine
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'—?
...
No, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
...
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know (ooh oh)
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe
...
Save it X the date on the wall
Hope you can make it
Tell your friends that they can come
Oh don't you worry everything gon' be great. Well worth the wait
Mmmmm
Walk in the room cover
Up your eyes
I know you wanna a big surprise
And make a wish for whatever you like one two, one two three four
We just here to say happy birthday
Birthday, 24 hours to celebrate
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
And we lived a life of pretty lies
You know it, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can compare though
And for that I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'ma 100% that kid
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got some problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a good friend, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New ones, like the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
Yeah
Found someone's name in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even know
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you know I knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flippin' on me, say I think too much
You're actin' different when we're talking, love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy (hey)
Where you been leavin'? (Hey)
You been keepin' me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love? (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Woah)
...
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both bug everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me (Woo)
...
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
...
Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones
Or grab your dance partner
And if you're by yourself, no worries
Just follow after me (Yeah)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Go'n throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back, put your hips in it
(Woo-hoo-hoo)
Let's have some fun (Uh)
To the left, to the left now (To the left, to the left)
To the right, to the right (To the right)
Now take your left hand and (Uh)
Put it on your side (Put it on your side)
Go and roll your shoulders (Roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (Do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part, uh
'Cause it's time to shine (Woo)
Go'n and do the two-step, then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it
(Uh, woo-hoo-hoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
...
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
You're so damn beautiful
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
...
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took another look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna hear how you sing (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't throw it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Yeah, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
We could hang out in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, my heart's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
These things always happen to me (Yeah)
...
Kidz Bop
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí (Jaja)
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready (Hey)
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
Con-con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
E' una asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
I like your dance moves, girl
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
Tiene adrenalina, en medio 'e la pista, ahí ella baila lo que sea
I like your dance moves, girl
Ya vi que estás solita, acompáñame
...
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
...
I'm curious about you,
So how's your day?
Oh tell me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah,
Oh Yeah Ah Yeah
What makes you happy instead of okay
Oh Text me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Your every picture
I want them all under my pillow
Oh Bae
Come be my teacher
I wanna know all about you
Your 1, Your 2
Listen my my baby I am
Flying high in the sky cause I'm with you
You know i can fly
Cause you gave me my wings
Now we are above it all
I want your eyes locked on mine
For the future
Yeah I'm making you a boy with luv
Oh my my my Oh my my my
I've waited all my life
I don't ever wanna leave your side
Oh my my my Oh my my my
Looking for something right
Didn't understand but I can't deny
Ohohoh I want something stronger
Ohohoh
Than a moment
Than a moment, love
Ohohoh I have waited longer
Ohohoh for a boy with
...
I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
Kidz Bop, bebé-bé
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, todos están pendiente' a ti (Wuh)
Pero tú puesta pa' mí (Ajá)
Haciendo que me odien más (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Porque todos te quieren mirar (Ah)
Lo que no saben es que no te dejas llevar de cualquiera
Y todos te quieren mirar (Ja)
Lo que no saben es que hoy yo te voy a buscar (Trr; yeah, yeah)
Dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo lo repetía
Yeah, dile que tú eres mía, mía
Tú sabe' que eres mía, mía
Tú misma lo decías
Cuando yo lo repetía
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Bebé, yo soy fan de ti al cantar (Wuh)
Te doy todo lo mío, hasta mi respirar (Yeah)
Contigo veo todo como en espiral (Yeah)
...
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know (ooh oh)
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
And I believe (I), oh I believe (I)
What You say of me (I)
I believe
...
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
I wanna go home
Party
Trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me's fallin' in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it
Taking the shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong
So I hold on
...
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons you'll say that i need help
We all got expectations and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me so i put it in this song
They tell me think with my head not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that i want if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And i say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll tell them a story they'll sit and nod their hands
...
Oh-woh
¿Qué pasa, Kidz Bop?
Hmm, jejeje
Hey, yeah (Ay)
Tengo en esta historia algo que confesar
Ya entendí muy bien qué fue lo que pasó
Y aunque duela tanto tengo que aceptar
Que tú no eres la mala, que el malo soy yo
No me conociste nunca de verdad
Ya se fue la magia que te enamoró
Y es que no quisiera estar en tu lugar
Porque tu error sólo fue conocerme
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (Soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir
Es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (Así)
Échame la culpa
No eres tú, no eres tú, no eres tú, soy yo (Soy yo)
No te quiero hacer sufrir
Es mejor olvidar y dejarlo así (Así)
Échame la culpa (Okay)
I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
I don't really, really want to fake it no more
...
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
...
I'm losing myself control
Yeah, you start and i trickle back in
But i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart i won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
I guess i could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain cause i can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But i guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and i
Can't keep going back i guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
No, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead (cough)
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
...
Dont you know I'm no good for you
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
I tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothing ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
...
Woah, yeah
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your music starts my heart, oh
Mess it up and make it just go crazy
I'm living for the song that you just made me love
I'm dreaming for the dancing on the daily
You're the only one that I want (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Break my heart, but don't tell me
I'm not doin' fine, 'cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine, but I'll do it fine
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'—?
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freak
Baby, come bring me help
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, you to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, that'll make it all right, yeah
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
All my life, been working and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a singer sellin' songs and I'm on a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and all the traders
So, I sang my song, get up and leave
I climb and I'm the bravest, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
...
Ella casi ni sale, la traicionó el amor
Tiene par de amistades, pero no quiere relación
Donde va sobresale, en sus ojos se ve la ilusión
Pero llamó a su amiga, que se olvide, que esta es su canción
Y baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa' que esto no pare (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila
Tengo que contarte ante' que esto acabe (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila (Baila, baila)
Ponle música pa' que este no pare (Uh, uh)
Baila, baila, baila
Tengo que contarte ante' que se acabe
Me gusta como te ves (Te ve'-e'-e')
Moviéndote, así es (Así e'-e')
Dejando la timidez (Woh, oh)
Me gusta' demasia'o, aquí me tienes admirándote (Admirándote)
Todo el tiempo imaginándote-e (Imaginándote)
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the night will come
Until you're done with running, I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made up my mind
And I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
You're always there to remind me
You take me there
When waters rough, you will still be there
Without your love
You're always there right beside me
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
...
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
...
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
I should be saving up, but
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
And it feels like every day's a holiday
So I can't take my cheque to the bank
And I know, know, know I should be worried
But I work, work, work to the bone, baby
So gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Woo)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Hey)
Gimme that money
I said, now, gimme that money
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month

Esto vamo' a arrancarlo con altura
El dembow lo canto con hondura
Dicen una estrella, una figura
De Héctor aprendí la sabrosura
Nunca viste una joya tan pura
Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura
(Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo rápido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)
Iré joven pa' la sepultura
(Con altura)
Esto es pa' que quede, lo que yo hago dura
(Con altura)
Demasiadas noches de travesura
(Con altura)
Vivo rápido y no tengo cura
(Con altura)
Iré joven pa' la sepultura
(Con altura)
Pongo rosas sobre el Panamera
Pongo palmas sobre la guantanamera
Llevo a Camarón en la guantera (De la Isla)
Lo hago para mi gente y lo hago a mi manera
Flores azules y quilates
Y si es mentira que me maten

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek, and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?
She played the fiddle in an Irish band

¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí (Jaja)
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready (Hey)
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
Con-con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
E' una asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
I like your dance moves, girl
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
Tiene adrenalina, en medio 'e la pista, ahí ella baila lo que sea
I like your dance moves, girl
Ya vi que estás solita, acompáñame

Blaue Lagunen, weißer Strand
Wir hab'n uns beide nicht gekannt
Doch es war mehr als nur ein Tanz
Hey Bella Donna!
Du bist für mich wie Sommer
Dein Lächeln ist wie Zauber
So magisch und so traumhaft
Hey Bella Donna!
Du strahlst heller als die Sonne
Trinken KiBa und 'ne Fanta
Dazu Eis und ganz viel Samba, ey
Ich will mit dir morgens aufsteh'n
Lieb' es, wenn du mein'n Hoodie trägst
Als ich dich sah, auf mei'm Radar
Da war mir klar
Das mit dir und mir könnte geh'n
Für wie lang, das werden wir seh'n
Vielleicht ein Tag oder ein Jahr
Oder wir steh'n irgendwann vorm Altar
Ich behandel' dich wie 'ne Königin
Nenn mir ein'n Ort und wir fliegen hin
Oder, wenn du willst, chill'n wir zu zweit
Auf meiner Terrasse bei Candlelight
Mädels wie du sind 'ne Rarität
Die mir vertrauen, die mich versteh'n
Und nicht nur das Geld auf dem Konto seh'n
...
Ich lieg' in deinem Arm und du redest wieder nur von dir
Oh, warum hab ich mich jetzt schon wieder hierher verirrt?
Du sprichst von Feten in New York, von Filmaufnahm'n in Paris
Mal ganz nebenbei gibst du die beste Party in Wien
Aha, hab' schon verstanden
Und alle meine Freunde finden, dass ich leiser bin
Dass ich leiser bin, leiser, seit ich bei dir bin
Alle meine Freunde fragen, ob ich glücklich bin
Weil ich leiser bin, leiser, seit ich bei dir bin
Alle meine Freunde
Alle meine Freunde
A-a-alle meine Freunde
Finden, dass ich leiser bin
Alle meine Freunde
Alle meine Freunde
A-a-alle meine Freunde
...
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
Hast du schon einen Regenbogen in Schwarz-Weiß gesehen?
Kinder, die immer nur leise sind? Das gibt es nicht
Hast du Träume, die du nicht erreichen kannst?
Gefühle, die du niemandem zeigen darfst?
Die gibt es nicht
Dreh dich um, dann kannst du über 'n Tellerrand seh'n
Alles bunt, musst nur ein Stückchen weiter geh'n
Ich spiel' die Luftgitarre und wir sing'n
Komm, lass uns die Welt bemal'n
In Regenbogenfarben
Wir woll'n sie überall
Regenbogenfahnen
Komm! Komm, lass die Welt erstrahl'n
In Regenbogenfarben
Man sieht sie überall
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
Der Applaus ist längst vorbei
Und dein Herz schwer wie Blei
Jeder redet auf dich ein
Trotzdem bist du so allein
Und du siehst so traurig aus
Komm in mein'n Arm, lass es raus
Glaub mir, ich war wo du bist
Und weiß, was es mit dir macht
Doch wenn du lachst
Kann ich es seh'n
Ich seh' dich
Mit all deinen Farben
Und deinen Narben
Hinter den Mauern
Ja ich seh' dich
Lass dir nichts sagen
Nein, lass dir nichts sagen
Weißt du denn gar nicht
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
Thought I'd end up with him
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Baby, keine ist so schön wie du
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Ich will mehr, ich bekomm' nicht genug
Wie du dich bewegst, ist nicht normal
Die anderen Mädels sind mir egal
Ich sag' es dir gerne noch einmal
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Phänomenal (Ey), so phänomenal
Zeig dein'n Hüftschwung bitte nochmal (Ey)
So phänomenal
Bist erste Liga, so wie Real (Ey)
Wenn die Sonne heut' aufgeht
Will ich uns noch beim Tanzen seh'n
Babe, ich sag's dir nochmal
Du bist so phänomenal, phänomenal
Ich seh' sie im Freibad steh'n, mhm
Mein Bruder sagt, "Komm, sprich sie einfach an!"
"Baby, soll'n wir'n Eis nehm'n?" Ey-ey
Sie zeigt mir ein Lächeln, tanzt mich an
Sie weiß, was sie tut, sie ist so gut drauf
Mit jeder Berührung schmilzt das Eis
Ihr Haar riecht nach Coco, mhm
Ihre goldene Haut, sie strahlt mich an
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Cuatro abrazos y un café, apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano, de todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Pa' sentir la arena en los pies
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
Ich fahr' bis es in den Beinen sticht
Mittelstreifen freihändig
Und alles zieht vorbei, doch ich
Seh' nur dich
Und ich fahr' schneller, als ich lenken kann
Fang' gar nicht erst zu denken an
Denn wenn ich denke, denk' ich dran
Denk' an dich
Mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht, rote Ampel, leere Stadt
Kann nicht schlafen, bin noch wach, bin noch wach
Mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht, rote Ampel, leere Stadt
Und ich frag' mich, was du machst
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht
...
Save it X the date on the wall
Hope you can make it
Tell your friends that they can come
Oh don't you worry everything gon' be great. Well worth the wait
Mmmmm
Walk in the room cover
Up your eyes
I know you wanna a big surprise
And make a wish for whatever you like one two, one two three four
We just here to say happy birthday
Birthday, 24 hours to celebrate
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
You got me some type of way (Hmm)
Ain't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)
I do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took another look at your face (Hmm)
Now I wanna hear how you sing (Mmm-mmm)
Usually don't throw it away (Yeah, yeah)
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it
Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Yeah, this ain't fair"
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
We could hang out in the mornin' (Mornin')
Yeah, yeah, my heart's yours
I know it ain't right, but I don't care (Care)
Break up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
These things always happen to me (Yeah)
...
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
...
I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
Yeah
Found someone's name in your Fendi coat
Even though you don't even know
Always changin' your access codes
Yeah, I can tell you know I knew
Yeah, you've been actin' so conspicuous
You flippin' on me, say I think too much
You're actin' different when we're talking, love
Baby, tell me, tell me
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know the truth (woah)
Who do you love, do you love now?
I know it's someone new
You ain't gotta make it easy (hey)
Where you been leavin'? (Hey)
You been keepin' me up at night
Just admit it
Who do you love, do you love now?
I wanna know, I wanna know who
Now, now, who do you, who do you love, love? (Yeah)
Now, now, who do you, who do you love now? (Woah)
...
Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each other's fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both bug everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like
So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al like
Animal like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without somebody
Close to me (Woo)
...
I'm losing myself control
Yeah, you start and i trickle back in
But i don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart i won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
I guess i could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain cause i can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself draw the line
And i do, i do
But once in a while i trip up and i cross the line
And i think of you
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But i guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and i
Can't keep going back i guess it's never really over, yeah
Two years and just like that my head still takes me back
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Oh, we were such a mess but wasn't it the best
Thought it was done but i guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if i think it over maybe you'll be coming over again
And i'll have to get over you all over again
Over you all over again
...
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
...
All my life, been working and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a singer sellin' songs and I'm on a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and all the traders
So, I sang my song, get up and leave
I climb and I'm the bravest, yeah
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
...
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
You're so damn beautiful
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
...
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
...
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
I should be saving up, but
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
I'm broke, but I'm ballin'
Don't know where we're going
We go in when we go out
I just got paid
And it feels like every day's a holiday
So I can't take my cheque to the bank
And I know, know, know I should be worried
But I work, work, work to the bone, baby
So gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Woo)
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that (Hey)
Gimme that money
I said, now, gimme that money
I should grow up some day 'cause I got bills to pay
I can't be living life at someone else's pace
I know I think too much, can't pay the rent this month
...
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, whoa
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
I wanna go home
Party
Trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me's fallin' in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it
Taking the shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong
So I hold on
...
I'm curious about you,
So how's your day?
Oh tell me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah,

What makes you happy instead of okay
Oh Text me
Oh Yeah Oh Yeah

Oh Bae

I wanna know all about you
Your 1, Your 2
Listen my my baby I am
Flying high in the sky cause I'm with you
You know i can fly
Cause you gave me my wings
Now we are above it all
I want your eyes locked on mine
For the future
Yeah I'm making you a boy with luv
Oh my my my Oh my my my

Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'ma 100% that kid
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got some problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a good friend, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why're you great 'til you gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New ones, like the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay
...
Dont you know I'm no good for you
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
I tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothing ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that
I could lie say I like it like that like it like that

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
Kissed her on the cheek, and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the store
She sang a song and taught me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me, "What does it mean, the Gaelic thing on your arm?"
Said, "It was one of my friend's songs, do you want to sing on?"
She took me out to a party just for the fun
We were singing at the table with our friends all singing along
Chatted some more, one more song on guitar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know?
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English friend
...
Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the night will come
Until you're done with running, I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try
I made up my mind
And I know, I know you'll be there
With just one touch, you take me there
Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
You're always there to remind me
You take me there
When waters rough, you will still be there
Without your love
You're always there right beside me
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch
...
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
...
It's sad, we're not together
But I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever
Love don't always make it through
Sometimes even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, but found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
...
I miss you pushing me close to the edge
I miss you
I wish I knew what I had when I left
I miss you
You set fire to my world, couldn't handle the heat
Now I'm sleeping alone and I'm starting to freak
Baby, come bring me help
Let it rain over me
Baby, come back to me
I want you to ruin my life
You to ruin my life, you to ruin my life, yeah
I want you to fuck up my nights, yeah
Fuck up my nights, yeah, all of my nights, yeah
I want you to bring it all on
If you make it all wrong, that'll make it all right, yeah
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I met you late night at a party
Some trust fund baby's brooklyn loft
By the bathroom you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and that's when she said
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
...
Woah, yeah
I've been waiting (I've been waiting)
I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your music starts my heart, oh
Mess it up and make it just go crazy
I'm living for the song that you just made me love
I'm dreaming for the dancing on the daily
You're the only one that I want (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Break my heart, but don't tell me
I'm not doin' fine, 'cause I'll do it fine
Let me go, I'm spendin' time
Not doin' fine, but I'll do it fine
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin'—?

¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
¿Cómo te llamas, baby?
Desde que te vi supe que eras pa' mí (Jaja)
Dile a tus amigas que andamo' ready (Hey)
Esto lo seguimos en el after party
Con-con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
E' una asesina, cuando baila quiere que to' el mundo la vea
I like your dance moves, girl
Con calma, yo quiero ver como ella lo menea
Baila este tune-tune, girl
Tiene adrenalina, en medio 'e la pista, ahí ella baila lo que sea
I like your dance moves, girl
Ya vi que estás solita, acompáñame

Blaue Lagunen, weißer Strand
Wir hab'n uns beide nicht gekannt
Doch es war mehr als nur ein Tanz
Hey Bella Donna!
Du bist für mich wie Sommer
Dein Lächeln ist wie Zauber
So magisch und so traumhaft
Hey Bella Donna!
Du strahlst heller als die Sonne
Trinken KiBa und 'ne Fanta
Dazu Eis und ganz viel Samba, ey
Ich will mit dir morgens aufsteh'n
Lieb' es, wenn du mein'n Hoodie trägst
Als ich dich sah, auf mei'm Radar
Da war mir klar
Das mit dir und mir könnte geh'n
Für wie lang, das werden wir seh'n
Vielleicht ein Tag oder ein Jahr
Oder wir steh'n irgendwann vorm Altar
Ich behandel' dich wie 'ne Königin
Nenn mir ein'n Ort und wir fliegen hin
Oder, wenn du willst, chill'n wir zu zweit
Auf meiner Terrasse bei Candlelight
Mädels wie du sind 'ne Rarität
Die mir vertrauen, die mich versteh'n
Und nicht nur das Geld auf dem Konto seh'n
...
Ich lieg' in deinem Arm und du redest wieder nur von dir
Oh, warum hab ich mich jetzt schon wieder hierher verirrt?
Du sprichst von Feten in New York, von Filmaufnahm'n in Paris
Mal ganz nebenbei gibst du die beste Party in Wien
Aha, hab' schon verstanden
Und alle meine Freunde finden, dass ich leiser bin
Dass ich leiser bin, leiser, seit ich bei dir bin
Alle meine Freunde fragen, ob ich glücklich bin
Weil ich leiser bin, leiser, seit ich bei dir bin
Alle meine Freunde
Alle meine Freunde
A-a-alle meine Freunde
Finden, dass ich leiser bin
Alle meine Freunde
Alle meine Freunde
A-a-alle meine Freunde
...
When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Na-na-na-na, don't call me up
When you're looking at the photos
Getting lost, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Na-na-na-na
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
Gotta leave it behind
One song and you're outta my mind
No, not again
Baby, I wanna hide
You're alone, going outta your mind
...
Hast du schon einen Regenbogen in Schwarz-Weiß gesehen?
Kinder, die immer nur leise sind? Das gibt es nicht
Hast du Träume, die du nicht erreichen kannst?
Gefühle, die du niemandem zeigen darfst?
Die gibt es nicht
Dreh dich um, dann kannst du über 'n Tellerrand seh'n
Alles bunt, musst nur ein Stückchen weiter geh'n
Ich spiel' die Luftgitarre und wir sing'n
Komm, lass uns die Welt bemal'n
In Regenbogenfarben
Wir woll'n sie überall
Regenbogenfahnen
Komm! Komm, lass die Welt erstrahl'n
In Regenbogenfarben
Man sieht sie überall
...
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw it all on the table
For your unrequited love
I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant
Woo
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant
Woo
Will be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
...
Der Applaus ist längst vorbei
Und dein Herz schwer wie Blei
Jeder redet auf dich ein
Trotzdem bist du so allein
Und du siehst so traurig aus
Komm in mein'n Arm, lass es raus
Glaub mir, ich war wo du bist
Und weiß, was es mit dir macht
Doch wenn du lachst
Kann ich es seh'n
Ich seh' dich
Mit all deinen Farben
Und deinen Narben
Hinter den Mauern
Ja ich seh' dich
Lass dir nichts sagen
Nein, lass dir nichts sagen
Weißt du denn gar nicht
...
This world can hurt you
It runs real deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live a life of pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These are just nothing but regrets
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's going, oh, we both know it
We got the time to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles where you are
...
Thought I'd end up with him, but he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you, then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say "thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so, I'm so
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
...
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
...
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Baby, keine ist so schön wie du
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Ich will mehr, ich bekomm' nicht genug
Wie du dich bewegst, ist nicht normal
Die anderen Mädels sind mir egal
Ich sag' es dir gerne noch einmal
Du bist phänomenal, phänomenal
Phänomenal (Ey), so phänomenal
Zeig dein'n Hüftschwung bitte nochmal (Ey)
So phänomenal
Bist erste Liga, so wie Real (Ey)
Wenn die Sonne heut' aufgeht
Will ich uns noch beim Tanzen seh'n
Babe, ich sag's dir nochmal
Du bist so phänomenal, phänomenal
Ich seh' sie im Freibad steh'n, mhm
Mein Bruder sagt, "Komm, sprich sie einfach an!"
"Baby, soll'n wir'n Eis nehm'n?" Ey-ey
Sie zeigt mir ein Lächeln, tanzt mich an
Sie weiß, was sie tut, sie ist so gut drauf
Mit jeder Berührung schmilzt das Eis
Ihr Haar riecht nach Coco, mhm
Ihre goldene Haut, sie strahlt mich an
...
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of girl that all the guys want
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool guys out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, ba-by
...
Cuatro abrazos y un café, apenas me desperté
Y al mirarte recordé que ya todo lo encontré
Tu mano en mi mano, de todo escapamos
Juntos ver el sol caer
Vamos pa' la playa, pa' curarte el alma
Cierra la pantalla, abre la Medalla
Todo el mar caribe, viendo tu cintura
Tú le coqueteas, tú eres buscabulla y me gusta
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Lento y contento, cara al viento
Pa' sentir la arena en los pies
...
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's, it won't burst my bubble
Girls with the dream who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (yeah)
Been through the baddest, I should be the saddest
Who would've thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with bows and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing (yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is popping
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds, so they know what this is
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
Ich fahr' bis es in den Beinen sticht
Mittelstreifen freihändig
Und alles zieht vorbei, doch ich
Seh' nur dich
Und ich fahr' schneller, als ich lenken kann
Fang' gar nicht erst zu denken an
Denn wenn ich denke, denk' ich dran
Denk' an dich
Mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht, rote Ampel, leere Stadt
Kann nicht schlafen, bin noch wach, bin noch wach
Mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht, rote Ampel, leere Stadt
Und ich frag' mich, was du machst
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, was du machst mit mir
Was du machst, mit'm Fahrrad durch die Nacht
...
Save it X the date on the wall
Hope you can make it
Tell your friends that they can come
Oh don't you worry everything gon' be great. Well worth the wait
Mmmmm
Walk in the room cover
Up your eyes
I know you wanna a big surprise
And make a wish for whatever you like one two, one two three four
We just here to say happy birthday
Birthday, 24 hours to celebrate
...
High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when you knew that I was willing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
...

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
...

'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push, and you push, and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give, and I give, and I give, and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me out of your life

Thought I'd end up with him, but he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about you, then
Now I listen and laugh
Even they can't compare though
And for that, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say "thank you" to that one
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me

They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to stoppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby

I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)

But you know we had something so good

Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
You're at your job working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As you're lying on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a bunch of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
...

He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)

He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)

He got me feelin' like

Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin' (Yeah)
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin' (What?)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Yeah)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us Kidz Bop, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
They dancing on top of the roof
Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
...
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let it move you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
This feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But i just can't it isn't in my blood
Laying on the bedroom floor feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
...
Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
Yeah, hmm
Ah yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, dancing here with you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I saying to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
...
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument
Every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
...

Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'

Haha, let's go
Haha, Kidz Bop, uh
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby, it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh

Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah

What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
We'll make you feel it outta your mind (Ooh)
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
Some days, things just
Take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate
People tell me to elevate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try
But you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
...
Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I fly
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push, and you push, and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give, and I give, and I give, and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
...
Yeah, KB, baby
I buy you somethin' cost more than a penny
Gotta be real with it
Yeah
Kiki, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and throw me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to stoppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby
...
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument
Every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
...
Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
...
All it'd take is one flight we'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline seeing all the rainbows i
I got an idea and i know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see you oh, i gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight
I'm a couple hundred miles from japan and i
I was thinking i could fly to your hotel tonight
Cause i can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind, oh
I can't seem to get you off my mind
I could feel the tension we could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah
Do i gotta convince you that you shouldn't fall asleep
...
High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when you knew that I was willing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
...
You probably think that you
Are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause
I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down
Let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
You know I say that
I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause
You're not around, not around
You know I never meant
To let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the trends oh
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
All these games just blowing up
And open your mind
We were lookin' forward
To the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture
Posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser
With the socks you don't like
And I'm going', going', going', goin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Thinking heavy and I'm tryna focus
But I can't get this stuff outta my head
...
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, stayed in touch
Used to talk underneath the light on the back of the bus
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way to stay on the phone and talk real late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
...
Took you like I thought
Thought that I could chase
You with a cold evening
Let a couple years water
Down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm getting close to someone else
You're stuck in my head
And I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
...
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align
Will heaven step in will it save us from our sin, will it
Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cut throat
You gotta be so cold
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let it move you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
This feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need another to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye, eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole life
For my whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (You ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (So independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen, so, baby...
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day until the night
Underneath the sunrise
...
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me
...
Took it like I thought
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm getting close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
...
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink...
Dive bar on the east side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink...
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
...
Everything's been so messed up here lately.
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby.
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me,
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay,
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me, yeah,
I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway!
"Everything's gonna be alright,
Everything's gonna be okay,
It's gonna be a good, good, life."
That's what my best friend say.
"Everything's gonna be alright,
Everything's gonna be just fine,
It's gonna be a good, good, life."
I'm a mess, a confuser,
I'm a hater, a refuser,
I'm a mess
For your love, it ain't new.
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed,
...
It never fades away it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice left in silence
Baby it hit so hard holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Cause baby i got these scars reminding me to forget
Reminding me i got these cars get your love
Keep reminding me oh... to forget your love
You left your mark my heart
You left your mark reminding me to forget
You left your mark my heart
You left your mark understand
...
Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet?
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad
Now don't you overreact
So I just hold my breath, don't know why
I can't see the sun when young should be fun (fun)
And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
And I can't hide
'Cause growing pains are keeping me up at night
...
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have
The love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have
The love we share
This is what we're waiting for
In my mind, in my head
This where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This where we all came from
And in my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we have
...
Du führst ein Leben ohne Sorgen
24 Stunden, 7 Tage nichts gefunden
Was du heute kannst besorgen
Das schiebst du ganz entspannt auf morgen
Ich hab' 'ne Weile gebraucht, um zu verstehen
Dass die Zeit reif ist, um jetzt zu gehen
Ich wünsch' dir noch 'n richtig geiles Leben
Denn wie du dich veränderst will ich mir nicht geben
Ich wünsch' dir noch 'n geiles Leben
Mit knallharten Megafeten
Mit Fame, viel Geld, dicken Villen und Sonnenbrillen
Ich seh' doch ganz genau, dass du eigentlich was Anderes willst
Ich wünsch' dir noch 'n geiles Leben
Ab jetzt wird es mir besser gehen
Vergiss die Fame, all die Villen und die Sonnenbrillen
Ich fühl' jetzt ganz genau, dass ich das zu meinem
Glück nicht brauch
...
I woke up with a fear this morning
But with the words still on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're on my mind and we've got air in our lungs
Last night, we were way up, talking in the back of the cab
And then you say, "Love, baby, let's go hang at the flat"
And when we dance, I never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
...
(Ay)
Havana, ooh na na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer day in June)
And then says he got love within him (ay)
He got me feelin' like
Oooh
I knew it when I met him
...
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', so we turn it up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Right now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
...
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But i just can't it isn't in my blood
Laying on the bedroom floor feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
Viertel vor, oh man, schon wieder spät dran
Ich muss rennen, da vorne kommt schon meine Bahn
Ja, ich weiß, es heißt, "Keiner wartet auf dich"
Wir treffen uns im gleichen Laden wie seit Jahren
Erzählen uns, was für einen Stress wir haben
Egal, Kopf aus, erinnerst du dich? (Erinnerst du dich?)
Wir haben uns mal geschworen (Hey!)
"Ey, wir warten nie auf morgen!" (Hey!)
Wir sind doch immer noch dieselben Clowns
Und Helden unserer Welt
Lass uns leben wie ein Feuerwerk, Feuerwerk, oh-oh
Als wenn es nur für heute wär', oh-oh
Denn dieser Augenblick kommt nie zurück
Lass uns leben wie ein Feuerwerk, Feuerwerk, oh-oh
Die ganze Welt kann uns gehören, oh-oh
...
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love?
What about trust?
What about us?
...
Warum machst du dir 'nen Kopf?
Wovor hast du Schiss?
Was gibt's da zu grübeln?
Was hast du gegen dich?
Ich versteh' dich nicht (Mmh)
Immer siehst du schwarz
Und bremst dich damit aus
Nichts ist gut genug
Du haust dich selber raus
Wann hörst du damit auf?
Wie ich dich seh' ist für dich unbegreiflich
Komm ich zeig's dir
Ich lass' Konfetti für dich regnen
Ich schütt' dich damit zu
Ruf' deinen Namen aus allen Boxen
Der beste Mensch bist du
Ich roll' den roten Teppich aus
...
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that I did that summer night, night
Lost in the feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let it move you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
This feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument
Every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, die immer lacht
Die ist die eine, die immer lacht
Die immer lacht, die immer lacht, die immer lacht
Oh, die immer lacht
Und nur sie weiß, es ist nicht wie es scheint
Oh, sie weint, oh, sie weint, sie weint
Aber nur, wenn sie alleine ist
Denn sie ist, denn sie ist die eine
Die immer lacht
Die immer lacht, immer lacht, immer lacht
Oh, die immer lacht
Oh, die immer lacht
Die immer lacht
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
I don't like your little games
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you will lie
You said this thing was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the day
I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
...
High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when you knew that I was willing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
...
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, stayed in touch
Used to talk underneath the light on the back of the bus
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way to stay on the phone and talk real late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide
And i reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again and i wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to brake
You say the cigarettes on the counter
Weren't your friends they were my mates
And i feel the color draining from my face
And my friends said i know you love her but it's over mate
It doesn't matter put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away let her go it'll be alright
...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
Ich ging wie ein Ägypter
Hab mit Tauben geweint
War ein Voodookind
Wie ein rollender Stein
Im Dornenwald sang Maria für mich
Ich starb in deinen Armen, Bochum '84
Ich ließ die Sonne nie untergeh'n
In meiner wundervollen Welt
Und ich singe diese Lieder
Tanz mit Tränen in den Augen
Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held
Und EMF kann es nich' glauben
Und ich steh im lila Regen
Ich will ein Feuerstarter sein
Whitney wird mich immer lieben
Und Michael lässt mich nich' allein
Ich war willkommen im Dschungel
Und fremd im eigenen Land
Mein persönlicher Jesus
Und im Gehirn total krank
Und ich frage mich, wann
Werd' ich, werd' ich berühmt sein
...
One kiss is all it takes

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me

Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I fly
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push, and you push, and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give, and I give, and I give, and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time

So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
...
I've been stuck in motion
Moving too fast
Tryna catch a moment but it slips through my hands
All I see are long days and dark nights
I'm lost without you, but I'm on my way, so hold tight
I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my gosh, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the sparks to fly
Into the morning
Oh my gosh, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
Don't wanna spend my whole life catching my breath
...
Kidz Bop music!
Haha, let's go
Haha, Kidz Bop, uh
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby, it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high (Put 'em high)
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Both arms, yeah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high
Put 'em up
Mama told you don't talk to strangers (Mama, mama)
But when you're ridin' in the drop, you can't explain it
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
We'll make you feel it outta your mind (Ooh)
...
Yeah, KB, baby
I buy you somethin' cost more than a penny
Gotta be real with it

Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and throw me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to stoppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby
...
I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And i see there's something you're trying to hide

...
Some days, things just
Take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate
People tell me to elevate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try
But you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'

I saw you came along
I felt me something strong
The room was kinda hazy
Been overthinking lately
And then you turned around
I looked you up and down
Just ask my heart about it
It's goin' crazy, I'm...
Sending all these vibes to you
I'm a lonely one, got my aim on you
I'm lucky that my wish came true
It turns out, that you are coming through
I wanna be your one and only

Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin' (Yeah)
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin' (What?)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Yeah)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us Kidz Bop, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
They dancing on top of the roof
Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
...
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
When it's Friday night and the sun don't work the same
...
You probably think that you
Are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause
I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down
Let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
You know I say that
I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause
You're not around, not around
You know I never meant
To let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the trends oh
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
All these games just blowing up
And open your mind
We were lookin' forward
To the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture
Posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser
With the socks you don't like
And I'm going', going', going', goin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Thinking heavy and I'm tryna focus
But I can't get this stuff outta my head
...
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', so we turn it up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Right now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
...
I will always remember
The day you kissed my cheek
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (Ooh)
Mmm, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
...
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But i just can't it isn't in my blood
Laying on the bedroom floor feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
...
They wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin'
And they wishin' on me, yo
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't call up at 6:00 a.m. to talk here with me
You know how I like it when you missin' on me
I don't wanna go for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, that was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down that way with me (yeah, wait)
I go up on Southside, yeah (yeah, wait)
...
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am
But still know that I'm good
Long as you're here with me
To be young and in love in New York City
We go into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking
Yeah
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
...
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too
Now well when I was young, we connected
When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the Fourth of July
...
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me
...
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin' (Yeah)
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin' (What?)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Yeah)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us Kidz Bop, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
They dancing on top of the roof
Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
...
Kidz Bop music!
Haha, let's go
Haha, Kidz Bop, uh
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby, it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high (Put 'em high)
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Both arms, yeah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high
Put 'em up
Mama told you don't talk to strangers (Mama, mama)
But when you're ridin' in the drop, you can't explain it
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
We'll make you feel it outta your mind (Ooh)
...
Spent so many hours, I need more hours with you
We spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent those date nights making things right between us
But now it's all good, babe
Roll it backwards, babe
And play me close
'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sun down when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you
I spent the last night on that last flight to you
But took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
...
Some days, things just
Take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate
People tell me to elevate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try
But you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
...
Remember the words you told me
Love me 'til the day I fly
Surrender my everything
'Cause you made me believe you're mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby
Now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own big game
You push, and you push, and I'm pulling away
Pulling away from you
I give, and I give, and I give, and you take
Give and you take
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me out of your life
But I'm just a sad man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Youngblood, say you want me
Say you want me back in your life
So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
...
Yeah, KB, baby
I buy you somethin' cost more than a penny
Gotta be real with it
Yeah
Kiki, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and throw me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to stoppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby
...
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument
Every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
...
Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
...
All it'd take is one flight we'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline seeing all the rainbows i
I got an idea and i know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see you oh, i gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight
I'm a couple hundred miles from japan and i
I was thinking i could fly to your hotel tonight
Cause i can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind, oh
I can't seem to get you off my mind
I could feel the tension we could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah
Do i gotta convince you that you shouldn't fall asleep
...
High, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when you knew that I was willing
Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said, fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater, go make a legacy
Manifest destiny, back in the day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said, burn your biographies
Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, every day
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up
It's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love
...
You probably think that you
Are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause
I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down
Let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
You know I say that
I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause
You're not around, not around
You know I never meant
To let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything
Woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the trends oh
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
All these games just blowing up
And open your mind
We were lookin' forward
To the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture
Posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser
With the socks you don't like
And I'm going', going', going', goin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Thinking heavy and I'm tryna focus
But I can't get this stuff outta my head
...
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, stayed in touch
Used to talk underneath the light on the back of the bus
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way to stay on the phone and talk real late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
...
Took you like I thought
Thought that I could chase
You with a cold evening
Let a couple years water
Down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm getting close to someone else
You're stuck in my head
And I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
...
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align
Will heaven step in will it save us from our sin, will it
Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heartache cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cut throat
You gotta be so cold
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
Let me take the night, it goes real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let it move you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
This feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you seem
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
...
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need another to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye, eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole life
For my whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (You ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent (So independent)
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You've got something to say and I'm here to listen, so, baby...
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day until the night
Underneath the sunrise
...
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen

You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
...
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
I know you heard it from those other boys
But this time it's real
It's something that I feel and
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way
If it feels like paradise running through our lovely veins
You know it's love heading your way

Pickin' it up, pickin' it up

Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Right now you know it, babe

Right now, I'm in a state of mind

So I'm just a sad man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
...
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
When it's Friday night and the sun don't work the same
...
Yeah, KB, baby

Gotta be real with it
Yeah
Kiki, do you love me? Are you with me?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya

KB, do you love me? Are you with me?

I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
Yeah, yeah, KB, baby
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
Some days, things just
Take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so overcomplicate
People tell me to elevate
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
How do I know if this is fabricated?
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try
But you tell me every time
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And breathin' and breathin'
...
You probably think that you
Are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause
I'm not around, not around

And I'm going', going', going', goin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Thinking heavy and I'm tryna focus
But I can't get this stuff outta my head
...
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
...
I will always remember
The day you kissed my cheek
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (Ooh)
Mmm, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
...
Leaving to find my soul
Told her I had to go
And I know it ain't pretty
When our hearts get broke
Too young to feel this old
Watching us both turn cold
Oh, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
Yeah, I know it ain't pretty
When two hearts get broke
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and
We'll wish we could come back to these days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know
These days, these days
...
I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one will love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me
...
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But i just can't it isn't in my blood
Laying on the bedroom floor feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
...
They wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin'
And they wishin' on me, yo
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't call up at 6:00 a.m. to talk here with me
You know how I like it when you missin' on me
I don't wanna go for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, that was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down that way with me (yeah, wait)
I go up on Southside, yeah (yeah, wait)
...
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—
Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stuntin', I like shinin' (Yeah)
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Yeah, I'm signin' (What?)
I like those Balenciagas (Those), the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (Yeah)
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (What?)
I like proving others wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call us Kidz Bop, banging party, spicy music, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari (Rrr, woo)
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (Coupe)
They dancing on top of the roof
Flexing on songs as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
...
Took you like I thought
Thought that I could chase
You with a cold evening
Let a couple years water
Down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm getting close to someone else
You're stuck in my head
And I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
...
Kidz Bop music!
Haha, let's go
Haha, Kidz Bop, uh
You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer
You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby, it's a no-brainer
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
In the middle, woah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high (Put 'em high)
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Both arms, yeah
Woah-woah-oah, oh, oh-oh, ooh
Put 'em high
Put 'em up
Mama told you don't talk to strangers (Mama, mama)
But when you're ridin' in the drop, you can't explain it
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt-skrrt)
What you been waitin' on this whole time? (Yeah)
We'll make you feel it outta your mind (Ooh)
...
Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick both of your feet up on the dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing but time
As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
I don't mean to be so uptight
...
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
...
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
...
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give my heart away
If he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus
When I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
...
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've bought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
As long as you love me so
...
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you
Shawty, with you
With you
Shawty, with you
With you
Under the mistletoe, yeah
Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeers flyin' through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you
...
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
...
It's Christmas
Baby, please come home
Yeah
(Christmas) the snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) watch the people around
(Christmas) baby, please come home
(Christmas) the church bells in town
(Christmas) they're ringing a song
(Christmas) what a happy sound
(Christmas) baby, please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
...
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
...
You know Dasher and Dancer,
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid,
And Donner and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Reindeer)
...
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
...

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
...
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel (you're a heel)
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch
I'm a bad banana with a
Greasy black peel
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul
Mr. Grinch
You wouldn't touch me with a

Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye
Ooh
...
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
...
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Christmas carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la
...
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there is a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of streetlights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Oh, Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
...
When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
He's put a great big smile upon somebody's face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Don't you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus is on the way
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing, and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the bells ring out for Christmas
...
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
With cold kiss from Santa
You'll tie tigger
With Dancer and Prancer
Go, go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the mistletoe
Til we drop!
Dancin' all night
Lets go baby go go go.
Here's my favorite holiday,
My favorite time of year.
With cards we write,
A Christmas lights all wrapped
With Christmas cheer.
Gifts we give are memories
Will make it fall someday
We wish we had our history
When troubles go away
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow

Ahahahahahahahaha
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna bring it tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
...
Ghostbusters
If there's something strange in your neighborhood
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
If there's something weird and it don't look good
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
If you're seeing things runnin' through your head
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
...
Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-eee"
It looks like a purple eater to me
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough"
...
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that I did that summer night, night
Lost in the feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
...
Ooh
Here come the Men In Black
It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's
Here come the Men In Black
(Men In Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me, MIB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't brink be what was there is now gone
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
(Ooh, ooh)
'Cause you never quite know where the MIB's is at
Uh, eh
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
Galaxy defenders
Oho oho oho
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
They won't let you remember
(Won't let you remember)
Aha, aha
Now, from the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like boom black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
...
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do
He said that
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice
And then the witch doctor
He game me this advice
He said that
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
Ooh-eee, ooh-ah-ah, ting tang
Walla walla, bing bang
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
On my life, on my head (don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
...
I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
They caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
...
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
I know someone who's tough but sweet
Oh so fine, he can't be beat
He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
...
They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams Family
Their house is a museum
Where people come to see-em
They really are a scream
The Addams Family
Neat
Sweet
Petite

I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got a bit surprised late last night
Werewolves of London again
...
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
So take a look what you've done
And baby now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinkin' that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Saltin' the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood

Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair

(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
...
Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
...
Little shop, little shoppa horrors
Little shop, little shoppa terror

Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
...
Hey! Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
Ding-dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below Yo-ho
Let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding-dong, the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead
Ding-dong, the witch is dead (yeah)
...
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But the evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet this devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
...
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be your slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?

Baby, lay on back and relax
Kick both of your feet up on the dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road is supposed to lead?
We got nothing but time
As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby, if it's meant to be
I don't mean to be so uptight
...
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last and
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
...
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (oh, yeah)
I'm pickin' it up (yeah), pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', so we turn it up
Yeah, we turnin' it up
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'
Comin' out, even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now, can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth, and if you don't know
Right now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
...
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that I did that summer night, night
Lost in the feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
...
You're at your job working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As you're lying on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a bunch of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
...
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But i just can't it isn't in my blood
Laying on the bedroom floor feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Help me it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
...
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up,
Make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you (beggin' you)
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
...
Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say I'm innocent
Not hardly, but I'm sorry
And all my friends, they know, and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone
On days like this, I do
...
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too
Now well when I was young, we connected
When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the Fourth of July
...
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am
But still know that I'm good
Long as you're here with me
To be young and in love in New York City
We go into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking
Yeah
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
...
They wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin'
And they wishin' on me, yo
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't call up at 6:00 a.m. to talk here with me
You know how I like it when you missin' on me
I don't wanna go for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, that was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yeah)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down that way with me (yeah, wait)
I go up on Southside, yeah (yeah, wait)
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
(Ay)
Havana, ooh na na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer day in June)
And then says he got love within him (ay)
He got me feelin' like
Oooh
I knew it when I met him
...
Ha, can't keep my thoughts to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
...
I don't like your little games
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you will lie
You said this thing was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the day
I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
...
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (aha)
KB, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (you see me?)
It's the big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (shook)
The big dance moves got all them kids hooked (hooked)
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (ha)
Come on sing to me while I do my money dance like ayy
Flexin' on the 'Gram like ayy
Hit the Lil' Jon, okay (okay), okay (okay)
Oh yeah, we drippin' in finesse and getting paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long (all night long)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever (forever)
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
...
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And it takes me back when I think of him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me to talk again
There's a boy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he says it in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for trying
You know I'd be lyin' saying
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally win me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
...
Why can't you just let this heartbreak kick in?
Rule number one: We can't still be friends
No late night phone calls
No 'How have you been's
I've seen that movie, I know how it ends
You start up the fight
Excuses to see me tonight
You say, "I'm moving on"
Then why are you back here in my arms?
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
Morning I wake up with you in my bed
...
Ooh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you break my head and not my heart?
I was lost, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been going on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're calling me baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Oooh-ooh (Yeah)
...
You must think that I'm silly
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
...
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last and
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
...
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she is never afraid
...
You know I'm back like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (another step)
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I fly
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And yeah, I'm great, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
Legend, it's exodus, searching your glory, yeah
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20 thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
...
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, look
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side
And look at me differently
Yeah
And last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night
I got high as the expectations
Last night
I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just take it slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
...
(Ay)
Havana, ooh na na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)

Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you

...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
Ha, can't keep my thoughts to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf

...
When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate
Then we'll find a way to cheat
'Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair
You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Hey, hey, hey
There is a condo in Manhattan
Hey there, hey what's hatning?
You and your friends invited
So gon' and get to dancing
And sing it with a friend
Sing it, sing it for me
Come on down and dance it with a friend
Dance, dance it with me
I have a beach house in Miami
Hang out in my jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Then we serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, hey, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on you
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
...
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love?
What about trust?
What about us?
...
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last and
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
...
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time (time) you are not around
I'm slowly drifting (away, drifting away)
Wave after wave (wave after wave)
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm falling
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave
Drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting, drifting away)
(Drifting, drifting away)
...
Ooh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you break my head and not my heart?
I was lost, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been going on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're calling me baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Oooh-ooh (Yeah)
...
I wish somebody would have told me babe
Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up, still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
...
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And it takes me back when I think of him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me to talk again
There's a boy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he says it in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for trying
You know I'd be lyin' saying
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally win me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
...
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment
Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed
It's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I
Ever did wasn't ever tryna make an issue for you
But, I guess the more you
Thought about everything,
You were never even wrong in the first place, right?
Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you, with my head down,
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you
Very loyal?
Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
...
Cut me right up in my love
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You oughta know
I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's too easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
...
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
...
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said things have changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
They were never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching gotta have it, yeah
I'm surrounded by all my friends, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
...
You must think that I'm silly
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así

(Ay)
Havana, ooh na na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer day in June)
And then says he got love within him (ay)
He got me feelin' like
Oooh
I knew it when I met him
...
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an unexposed location, location
These dry eyes lookin' for the sun
Paradise, we live it, and we call it a vacation, vacation
You're painting me a dream that I
Wouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in
Over the hills and far away, a million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away, some place where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
...
I don't like your little games
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you will lie
You said this thing was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the day
I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (aha)
KB, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game (you see me?)
It's the big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (shook)
The big dance moves got all them kids hooked (hooked)
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (ha)
Come on sing to me while I do my money dance like ayy
Flexin' on the 'Gram like ayy
Hit the Lil' Jon, okay (okay), okay (okay)
Oh yeah, we drippin' in finesse and getting paid, ow
Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long (all night long)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads forever (forever)
So tonight, I'm gonna show you off
When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No, my baby, don't play
Blame it on my confidence
...
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love?
What about trust?
What about us?
...
Payback's gonna happen
And baby, I'm the baddest
(I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest...)
Go
Now, I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a win, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now, payback's from heaven
And baby, I'm the baddest
You're dealin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just take it slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
...
Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay
I got the keys to the universe so stay
With me, 'cause I got the keys, baby
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering "where'd it all go?"
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We coming home tonight
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
Ooh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you break my head and not my heart?
I was lost, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been going on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're calling me baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Oooh-ooh (Yeah)
...
Cut me right up in my love
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You oughta know
I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's too easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
...
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or food, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that I did that summer night, night
Lost in the feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves to get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger, all for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
...
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
...

You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear, that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
You may think, that you'll die without her
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
You must think that I'm silly
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
...
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said things have changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
They were never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching gotta have it, yeah
I'm surrounded by all my friends, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
...
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
...
I'm not sure just what you heard
But I know a simple trick
You put both hands up clap them above
Do it do it just like this
I think I might have got the dancing sickness
Never ever had a fever like this
But where's the fun of being normal anywhere
Ok 5 4 3 2 1
I feel like turning it up
Breaking it down
Jump on my feet don't touch the ground
You got a voice you got a choice
Come on get loud let's make some noise
Sing it like
Oooooooooh oooooooooh
This is the time it's you and I
Let's get lalalala loud
...
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And it takes me back when I think of him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me to talk again
There's a boy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he says it in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for trying
You know I'd be lyin' saying
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally win me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain)
...
It's keeping me awake
Wonder why I feel this type of way
Like I never knew that I could fly
Finally got my chance
To reach the sky
Now I wanna go out
So I'm gonna go out
No stopping me now
No stopping me now
'Cause I'm gonna go out
'Cause I'm gonna go out
Wave at the clouds
No one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
Come and take my hand
Gotta say that I'm your biggest fan
Bet you won't believe the crazy things
It's that brand new world
That you gotta see
Now I wanna go out
...
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
...
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down,
Are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
...
Ha, can't keep my thoughts to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
...
I wish somebody would have told me babe
Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up, still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
...
It's 5:00 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to say hello
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not over it
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
...
Do that one dance, man
That, that one dance
Yeah (yeah)
Walked in this party

Skinny jeans on and you know my hair crazy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey

Go crazy
You your daddy's son
Ayy, ayy
...
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down (never let me down)
It's been a real crazy ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
...
And you got me like, ah
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price is too high
Baby you got me like, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Whoo, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Don't you stop loving me
(Loving me)
Don't quit loving me
(Loving me)
Just start loving me
(Loving me)
Oh oh oh
And babe
I'm just fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we learn something babe?
And I'll run for miles
Just to see your face
Must be love on the brain
...
I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now
Know I need you 'round with me
But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups
Yeah the ups and the downs with me
Got a whole lot of love
But you don't wanna spread it 'round with me, yeah
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line
Baby I done, done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
Baby we done, done enough talking
Gotta be right now, right now
Baby gon' love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey, hey
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know I wanna keep you around
...
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, and after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become
'Cause you brought the flames and you know it too well
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell
...
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got
Just stop looking for love
You still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
This could be something if you let it be something
Don't scare it away, turning somethings into nothing, babe
You're already used to the games, babe
You play your role and I play the same
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
I can tell you've been bored all day
'Cause you're young and you still got time
Don't waste your time
You've been wasting away, oh yeah
And no matter what you say, oh yeah
That smile gon take you places
And I know you wanna see some faces
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
...
Hey, hey, hey
There is a condo in Manhattan
Hey there, hey what's hatning?
You and your friends invited
So gon' and get to dancing
And sing it with a friend
Sing it, sing it for me
Come on down and dance it with a friend
Dance, dance it with me

Hang out in my jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Then we serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, hey, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on you
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
...
I've been feeling lonely
I need someone to tell me
Come on baby tell me
Yeah, I been feeling jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it
Now you, you been moving on
Let me know can I come along
Since you're gone, oh it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own
Living in a haze
Staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break
Can I get an amen
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Oh, oh
...
Why can't you just let this heartbreak kick in?
Rule number one: We can't still be friends
No late night phone calls
No 'How have you been's
I've seen that movie, I know how it ends
You start up the fight
Excuses to see me tonight
You say, "I'm moving on"
Then why are you back here in my arms?
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
Morning I wake up with you in my bed
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
You know I'm back like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (another step)
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I fly
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And yeah, I'm great, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
Legend, it's exodus, searching your glory, yeah
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20 thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
...
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, look
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side
And look at me differently
Yeah
And last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night
I got high as the expectations
Last night
I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
...
When you're low
And your knees can't rise
You feel helpless
And you're looking to the sky
Some people would say
To accept their fate
Well, if this is fate
Then we'll find a way to cheat
'Cause, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh we'll say a little prayer
But, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh if the answer isn't fair
You know you can call on me
When you need somebody
You know you can call on me
When you can't stop the tears from falling down, down, down
You know you can call on me
Call on me, darling
...
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time (time) you are not around
I'm slowly drifting (away, drifting away)
Wave after wave (wave after wave)
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm falling
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave
Drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting, drifting away)
(Drifting, drifting away)
...
Oh-oh, ooh
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
Runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
You've been going round, going round, going round every party in L.A.
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
Runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're,
...
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving like 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
...
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I talk too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty but you are so far
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer as we stand against Rover
That I know they can't afford
Brush that stress right off your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the notebook that you stole
From your friends way back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
...
I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she is never afraid
...
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm up, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just this fast
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
...
I'm the one (yeah)
KIDZ BOP
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you gotta rise now
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride!)
Yeah, you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
(Okay, go!) lookin' for the one?
Well, yeah, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
...
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said things have changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
They were never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching gotta have it, yeah
I'm surrounded by all my friends, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh ooh
The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain)
...
Hey
No nothing ever lasts forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow (hey)
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)
The way you move it here (hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (hey, ooh)
Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper (hey hi), sucker for your love, oh (yes)
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual (virtual) reality (hey yeah)
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar (hey)
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
...
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
...
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
...
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, and after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become
'Cause you brought the flames and you know it too well
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell
...
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
...
Time flies by when the night is young
Daylight shines on an unexposed location, location
These dry eyes lookin' for the sun
Paradise, we live it, and we call it a vacation, vacation
You're painting me a dream that I
Wouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in
Over the hills and far away, a million miles from L.A.
Just anywhere away with you
I know we've got to get away, some place where no one knows our name
We'll find the start of something new
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Just take me anywhere (anywhere), take me anywhere
Anywhere away with you
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over me
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
...
Payback's gonna happen
And baby, I'm the baddest
(I'm the baddest, I'm the baddest...)
Go
Now, I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a win, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse (wait a minute)
Now, payback's from heaven
And baby, I'm the baddest
You're dealin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (ah)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Bein' so bad got me feelin' so good
...
It's 5:00 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to say hello
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not over it
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
...
I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
...
Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay
I got the keys to the universe so stay
With me, 'cause I got the keys, baby
Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more
I wanna live fast and never look back, that's what we here for
Don't wanna wake up one day wondering "where'd it all go?"
'Cause we'll be home before we know, I wanna hear you sing it
Hey, mama, don't stress your mind
We coming home tonight
Hey, mama, we gonna be alright
Dry those eyes
We'll be back in the morning when the sun starts to rise
So mama, don't stress your mind
...
I had a dream
You were hanging out with me
Highest floor, the Bowery
Nowhere's far enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you've been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna help you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to take you home when you're through and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
Oh, oh, Bowery
Oh, oh, out with me
Where you go? I, I
...
Do that one dance, man
That, that one dance
Yeah (yeah)
Walked in this party
And these girls lookin' at me
Skinny jeans on and you know my hair crazy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey
Okay, okay, I want y'all do it, do this dance now

Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
Go crazy
You your daddy's son
Ayy, ayy
...
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down (never let me down)
It's been a real crazy ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
...
And you got me like, ah
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price is too high
Baby you got me like, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Whoo, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Don't you stop loving me
(Loving me)
Don't quit loving me
(Loving me)
Just start loving me
(Loving me)
Oh oh oh
And babe
I'm just fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we learn something babe?
And I'll run for miles
Just to see your face
Must be love on the brain
...
You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear, that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
You may think, that you'll die without her
...
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm hm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you
Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
...
I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now
Know I need you 'round with me
But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups
Yeah the ups and the downs with me
Got a whole lot of love
But you don't wanna spread it 'round with me, yeah
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Now I gotta draw a line
Baby I done, done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
Baby we done, done enough talking
Gotta be right now, right now
Baby gon' love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never, hey, hey, hey
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever, hey, hey, hey
Said you know I wanna keep you around
...
We were staying in Paris
And we're away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a pic. right now
I don't think that we could work this out."
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, "How could I let you go by yourself
While I'm going with someone else?"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
We were away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown like you only get
Posting pictures of your trip on the Internet
...
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We sang so much
I held your hand
That way you were singing, oh
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was feeling older
I said I thought you were the best
And you asked me to stand closer
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
...
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
...
Why can't you just let this heartbreak kick in?
Rule number one: We can't still be friends
No late night phone calls
No 'How have you been's
I've seen that movie, I know how it ends
You start up the fight
Excuses to see me tonight
You say, "I'm moving on"
Then why are you back here in my arms?
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
You never let me let you go
You never let me let you go
Every time I try telling you goodbye
You show up at my home
Morning I wake up with you in my bed
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got
Just stop looking for love
You still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
This could be something if you let it be something
Don't scare it away, turning somethings into nothing, babe
You're already used to the games, babe
You play your role and I play the same
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
I can tell you've been bored all day
'Cause you're young and you still got time
Don't waste your time
You've been wasting away, oh yeah
And no matter what you say, oh yeah
That smile gon take you places
And I know you wanna see some faces
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
...
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
...
Yeah, I can see the way you're dancing
Dance here with me
I know it's crazy but I feel like you could be
The one that I've been chasing in my dreams
Yeah, I can see you're dancing with me like you know
Oh, usually, I'm like "Whatever," but tonight
The way you're singing got me with my mind
It started when I looked in her eyes
I walked up and I'm like "Bailemos", hey
La noche está para un reggaetón lento
De esos que no se bailan hace tiempo
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó
Me pegué y la invité: "Bailemos?", hey
So now we're dancing un reggaetón lento
Just dance a little more, now baby, let go
Excuse me but you know I just have to dance with you, no
There's nobody in it that's close to us, no
Your hands on your waist, the smile is on your face
Come, muévete, muévete, muévete
...
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of look you're wearing tonight
If he's holding on your hands so tight
The way I did before
I overlooked
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
...
I've been feeling lonely
I need someone to tell me
Come on baby tell me
Yeah, I been feeling jaded
Don't know how I should play it
Tell me how to play it
Now you, you been moving on
Let me know can I come along
Since you're gone, oh it's been so long
On my own, my own, my own, my own
Living in a haze
Staying in the shade
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
I could use a break
Can I get an amen
All I do is sit around and wait for better days
Oh, oh
...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Been sitting eyes wide open
Behind these four walls
Hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Up all night, all night
And every day
Give me something
Or will you say nothing?
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I just wanna keep calling your name
Oh oh
Until you come back home
...
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'?
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
...
You know I'm back like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (another step)
Another day, another breath (another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I fly
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And yeah, I'm great, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
Legend, it's exodus, searching your glory, yeah
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20 thousand deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
...
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, look
I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side
And look at me differently
Yeah
And last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night
I got high as the expectations
Last night
I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
...
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down,
Are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
...
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia?
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free, hmh
Dance, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
...
It's keeping me awake
Wonder why I feel this type of way
Like I never knew that I could fly
Finally got my chance
To reach the sky
Now I wanna go out
So I'm gonna go out
No stopping me now
No stopping me now
'Cause I'm gonna go out
'Cause I'm gonna go out
Wave at the clouds
No one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
Come and take my hand
Gotta say that I'm your biggest fan
Bet you won't believe the crazy things
It's that brand new world
That you gotta see
Now I wanna go out
...
Just a young one with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
...
I don't like your little games
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you will lie
You said this thing was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the day
I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
...
Ha, can't keep my thoughts to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
...
Cut me right up in my love
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit I love even harder
You oughta know
I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's too easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one another
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
...
(Ay)
Havana, ooh na na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na na na (ay)
All of my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there's a lot of girls I can talk with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer day in June)
And then says he got love within him (ay)
He got me feelin' like
Oooh
I knew it when I met him
...
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love?
What about trust?
What about us?
...
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And it takes me back when I think of him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me to talk again
There's a boy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he says it in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love (ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for trying
You know I'd be lyin' saying
You were the one (ooh-ooh)
That could finally win me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just take it slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
...
Ooh, yeah
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you break my head and not my heart?
I was lost, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been going on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're calling me baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Oooh-ooh (Yeah)
...
One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's sad and alone
Two: Don't let win
You'll have to let him down again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna meet up with your friends in the morning
And if you're there with him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I got new rules, I count 'em (hey, hey)
I gotta tell them to myself (hey, hey)
...
You must think that I'm silly
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
...
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta
I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
...
I wish somebody would have told me babe
Some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
And all these reckless nights you won't regret
Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change
You'll miss the magic of these good old days
I was thinking about the band
I was thinking about the fans
We were underground
Loaded merch in that 12-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at
Still growing up, still growing up
I'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become
Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be someone
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days
I wish somebody would have told me babe
That some day, these will be the good old days
All the love you won't forget
...
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza, ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie, así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Y me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo como los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así
Estamos rompiendo la discoteca
La fiesta no para, apenas comienza
C'est comme-ci (eh!), c'est comme-ça (eh!)
...
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, and after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become
'Cause you brought the flames and you know it too well
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell
...
You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
Oh so hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care, oh care
Mmmbop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
...
Jump, jump

As we stand there totally krossed out
We commence to make you

'Cause inside-out its wiggida wiggida wiggida wack

A Daddy Mac will make ya jump, jump

You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
Yes I know, it's too late
...
Ah, say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going 'round in circles
Tell me, will this déjà vu never end? Oh
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ayy
This time, gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me
But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear (I'll give you everything)
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
I'm the one (yeah)
KIDZ BOP
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn, know you gotta rise now
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride!)
I'm the one, yeah (let's ride!)
Yeah, you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate ya
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the one
Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh
I'm the only one
(Okay, go!) lookin' for the one?
Well, yeah, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
...
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving like 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
...
We were staying in Paris
And we're away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a pic. right now
I don't think that we could work this out."
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, "How could I let you go by yourself
While I'm going with someone else?"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
We were away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown like you only get
Posting pictures of your trip on the Internet
...
I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she is never afraid
...
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Ask you once, ask you twice now
There's lipstick on your collar
You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her?
So you want to go on with someone to
Do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up, don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
That's a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done
...
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia?
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free, hmh
Dance, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
...
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you
...
I woke up with a fear this morning
But with the words still on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're on my mind and we've got air in our lungs
Last night, we were way up, talking in the back of the cab
And then you say, "Love, baby, let's go hang at the flat"
And when we dance, I never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm
No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
...
I had a dream
You were hanging out with me
Highest floor, the Bowery
Nowhere's far enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you've been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna help you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to take you home when you're through and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
Oh, oh, Bowery
Oh, oh, out with me
Where you go? I, I
...
Oh-oh, ooh
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
Runnin' round throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
You've been going round, going round, going round every party in L.A.
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one, oh
I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
Runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're,
...
Hey
No nothing ever lasts forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow (hey)
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)
The way you move it here (hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (hey, ooh)
Don't be afraid to catch feels (ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me
I'm your window shopper (hey hi), sucker for your love, oh (yes)
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual (virtual) reality (hey yeah)
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar (hey)
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
...
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm up, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just this fast
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
...
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I talk too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty but you are so far
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer as we stand against Rover
That I know they can't afford
Brush that stress right off your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the notebook that you stole
From your friends way back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
...
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We sang so much
I held your hand
That way you were singing, oh
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was feeling older
I said I thought you were the best
And you asked me to stand closer
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Been sitting eyes wide open
Behind these four walls
Hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Up all night, all night
And every day
Give me something
Or will you say nothing?
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I just wanna keep calling your name
Oh oh
Until you come back home
...
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
...
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of look you're wearing tonight
If he's holding on your hands so tight
The way I did before
I overlooked
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
...
You already know who it is

I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
...
Hey
No nothing ever lasts forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow (hey)
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me (yeah)
The way you move it here (hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (hey, ooh)

As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
...
I wanna follow her where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let it take control
'Cause every time that she gets closer
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing
Oh, I've been shaking
I love you when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she is never afraid
...
I'm the one (yeah)
KIDZ BOP
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie, no

The way that things have been, oh ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
(Pain, pain)
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
(Pain)
...
I don't wanna fight right now
Know you always right, now

But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups

Got a whole lot of love
But you don't wanna spread it 'round with me, yeah
Never pick up, never call me
You know we're runnin' out of time

You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, oh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you
You've been runnin' round, runnin' round,
Runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're,
...
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu

They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations"
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation

People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

But they didn't know me last year, yeah
...
It's 5:00 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to say hello
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not over it
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear, that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
You may think, that you'll die without her
...
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
...
Do that one dance, man
That, that one dance
Yeah (yeah)

I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
This is how we do, KIDZ BOP!
It's my house, come on, turn it up
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before so you all come in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Play a song something good, come on, dance to this
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what it is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
Welcome to my house

"Ooh I love your style"
Uh huh show me how you dance
Come and make it worth my while
...
Ah ah
Ah ah
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing you, and now I'm sorry, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down (never let me down)
It's been a real crazy ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah

As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Confessing

Manipulate my decisions

...
It's 5:00 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to say hello
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not over it
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
...
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Ohh, tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh every time I watch you serpentine
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
...
You think, that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear, that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club
You may think, that you'll die without her
...
No limit in the sky
That I won't fly for ya (for ya, for ya, for ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes
That I won't cry for ya (for ya), oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep
When it comes to you
There's no crime
Let's take both of our souls
And intertwine
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
...
Do that one dance, man
That, that one dance
Yeah (yeah)
Walked in this party
And these girls lookin' at me
Skinny jeans on and you know my hair crazy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey
Okay, okay, I want y'all do it, do this dance now
Juju on the beat (juju)
Juju on that beat (okay)
Juju on that, juju on that, juju on that beat
Now slide, drop
Show them folks, don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Don't stop, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat, ayy
Running man on that beat
Now do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, ayy
Go crazy
You your daddy's son
Ayy, ayy
...
I've been standing at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Though I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
...
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down (never let me down)
It's been a real crazy ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
...
Hey, hey, hey
There is a condo in Manhattan
Hey there, hey what's hatning?
You and your friends invited
So gon' and get to dancing
And sing it with a friend
Sing it, sing it for me
Come on down and dance it with a friend
Dance, dance it with me
I have a beach house in Miami
Hang out in my jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Then we serve that scampi
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, hey, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on you
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
...
We were staying in Paris
And we're away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a pic. right now
I don't think that we could work this out."
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, "How could I let you go by yourself
While I'm going with someone else?"
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
We were away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown like you only get
Posting pictures of your trip on the Internet
...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Been sitting eyes wide open
Behind these four walls
Hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Up all night, all night
And every day
Give me something
Or will you say nothing?
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I just wanna keep calling your name
Oh oh
Until you come back home
...
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm
Hm hm hm hm hm
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you
Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
...
I had a dream
You were hanging out with me
Highest floor, the Bowery
Nowhere's far enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough
No, I don't wanna know
Where you've been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna help you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to take you home when you're through and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
Oh, oh, Bowery
Oh, oh, out with me
Where you go? I, I
...
And you got me like, ah
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart
But the price is too high
Baby you got me like, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Whoo, ah ah ah ah ah ah
Don't you stop loving me
(Loving me)
Don't quit loving me
(Loving me)
Just start loving me
(Loving me)
Oh oh oh
And babe
I'm just fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we learn something babe?
And I'll run for miles
Just to see your face
Must be love on the brain
...
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I can give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We could stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking Coca-Cola
Underneath the midday sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking
So stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
...
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
...
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got
Just stop looking for love
You still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
This could be something if you let it be something
Don't scare it away, turning somethings into nothing, babe
You're already used to the games, babe
You play your role and I play the same
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
Come sing it with me, yeah, oh yeah
I can tell you've been bored all day
'Cause you're young and you still got time
Don't waste your time
You've been wasting away, oh yeah
And no matter what you say, oh yeah
That smile gon take you places
And I know you wanna see some faces
Just stop looking for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
...
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm up, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just this fast
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
...
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving like 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
...
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
...
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down,
Are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
...
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia?
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free, hmh
Dance, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
...
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We sang so much
I held your hand
That way you were singing, oh
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was feeling older
I said I thought you were the best
And you asked me to stand closer
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
...
What do you mean? Oooh
When you sometimes say yes
But you sometimes say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, hanging out all night.
First you up and you're down and then between
...
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
I know what you came here to see
If you can dance, then ya dancing here with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now come on over let me see you just
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
You girls dressed to twirl
I do hot tricks (?)
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these hands in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...
It's keeping me awake
Wonder why I feel this type of way
Like I never knew that I could fly
Finally got my chance
To reach the sky
Now I wanna go out
So I'm gonna go out
No stopping me now
No stopping me now
'Cause I'm gonna go out
'Cause I'm gonna go out
Wave at the clouds
No one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
Come and take my hand
Gotta say that I'm your biggest fan
Bet you won't believe the crazy things
It's that brand new world
That you gotta see
Now I wanna go out
...
Hey, hey, hey
There is a condo in Manhattan
Hey there, hey what's hatning?

Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down,
Are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
...
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia?
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free, hmh
Dance, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
...
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We sang so much
I held your hand
That way you were singing, oh
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was feeling older
I said I thought you were the best
And you asked me to stand closer
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
...
It's keeping me awake
Wonder why I feel this type of way
Like I never knew that I could fly
Finally got my chance
To reach the sky
Now I wanna go out
So I'm gonna go out
No stopping me now
No stopping me now
'Cause I'm gonna go out
'Cause I'm gonna go out
Wave at the clouds
No one's gonna stop me now
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Gonna have the best time ever
I'm gonna have the best time ever
Hey oh, hey oh
Come and take my hand
Gotta say that I'm your biggest fan
Bet you won't believe the crazy things
It's that brand new world
That you gotta see
Now I wanna go out
...
Yeah, hmm
Ah yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, dancing here with you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I saying to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
...

Known to give the color red the blues

So many pretty ones around me and they know just how to talk it
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face

This is a shout out to my ex
Heard he in love with some other girl
Yeah, yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better yet
Hope she ain't falling you like I did, baby
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it
Guess I should say thank you

Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go 'head, babe, I'ma live my life, my life, yeah

But you sometimes say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, hanging out all night.
First you up and you're down and then between
...
One dance kidz bop
Baby, I like your style.
Dance face to face this way to that way.
You know that I don't play.
Street's not safe, but i'll never run away--even when i'm away.
Oh yeah oh yeah.
There's never much love when we run away.
I pray we make it back in one piece.
I pray i pray.
Thats why i need a one dance.
Couple your hands in my hands.
One more dance 'fore i go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.(
Sing twice)
...
I stay up too late
Got nothin' in my brain
And that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
...
Mmmm... yeah... mm... yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm... yeah... uh... mm... yeah, yeah
Listen
Baby I just don't get it (get it)
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories (stories)
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are), whoo
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby girl, good love and protection
Make me your selection
I'll show you
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely."
Once I was eleven years old
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
...
I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
...
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
...
Everybody gets sad sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be sad on your own
And if you feel you're sinking,
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
...

You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm! but I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fit
Work work work work work work
He said me haffi
Work work work work work work
...
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
Ah ah
Ah ah
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing you, and now I'm sorry, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
...
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down
...
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my other
Move on
You watch me run until I can't breathe (whoo), shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself (whoo), aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you pulled me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your beating heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
...
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
...
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
...
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
Crazy
And the more I think, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you
Do you think of me?
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends're all acting strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
...
That's my girl
Yeah, who's been working so so hard?
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this stress out body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad?
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder
Then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
...
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I talk too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty but you are so far
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer as we stand against Rover
That I know they can't afford
Brush that stress right off your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the notebook that you stole
From your friends way back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
...
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of look you're wearing tonight
If he's holding on your hands so tight
The way I did before
I overlooked
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
...
Why wait to say
At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move
And it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
...
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and hold her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
...
I, was the knight in shining armor in your movie
We put your hand in mine and love the afterthought now
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I just can't concentrate
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that thing is broken, that thing is broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
(Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low)
...
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth
Don't care what you say to me, I'ma bite the feelings out (gold up in my teeth)
I missed it in the basement (gold up in my teeth)
Running on the pavement (gold up in my teeth)
And if you love me, love me but you never let me go
When the roof is on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth)
...
Walking there to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
If the whole world was watching, I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mm-mm-mm
...
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
"I'd sing for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A song for them, a song for you
A song for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many songs coming through
See many songs coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
...
Telling me this
And telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I'll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya
I'mma show you that where you from don't matter to me
She said, "Hola. ¿Cómo estás?" She said, "Konnichiwa."
She said, "Pardon my French," I said, "Bonjour, Madame."
...
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
Who's that pretty girl I see over there
That's me, standing in the mirror
What's that icy thing hanging around my neck
That's gold
Show me some respect, ah
I thank God every day (uh-huh)
That I woke up feeling this way (uh-huh)
And I can't help loving myself
And I don't nobody else, nah uh
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
...
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes,
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely"
And ever since that day...
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy," they say to me,
"Away from all of reality"
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
...
I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
First you gonna say you ain't runnin'
Game, thinkin' I'm believing every word
Call me beautiful, so original, telling me I'm not like other girls
I was in my zone before you came
Along, now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the I, to the no, no, no
All my ladies listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl all you gotta say is
My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
...
This is how we do, KIDZ BOP!
It's my house, come on, turn it up
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before so you all come in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Play a song something good, come on, dance to this
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what it is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
Welcome to my house
Come on, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me how you dance now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
...
For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own. Well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't,
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back,
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job,
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know,
I'm better leaving on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
...
I used to be so happy
But without here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die
Till the day I die
Funny how we both end happy but everything seems alright, ooh
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
...
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were sitting on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
...
Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a Another
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
...
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
...
I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game mm, mm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
...
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
...
I'm not nervous I'm not scared I feel the energy in the air.
Inside I'm ready I feel so cool and I bet you feel it too!
Well my heart skips, skips a beat, and I don't care what you see I'll take my
Chance on breaking it down and going all out right now now now and I'll be the Life Of The Party I'll take that one first step and the rest is history turn up
The beat and get started I'm gonna move my feet like the day was made for me.
OH AAAE OH AAAE OH AAAE OH OH OH.
I'll be the Life Of The Party I'll take that
One first step yeah (woo).
It's so electric and it's so bright well I see it in your eyes you are amazing and so am I what what
...
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as well
He's so good, and he knows it too well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in the air, he looks across the room
...
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Anytime you needed to talk
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city
You started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
...
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said
I know I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget
You know I don't believe, I don't believe it You left in peace, left me in pieces
To hard to breath
I'm on my knees right know, oh
I'm so sick of that same old love
That love it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
My heart has had enough
Ohh (That same old love)
Ohh (That same old love)
I'm not spending any time
Wasting tonight on you
I know I've heard it all so don't you try and change your mind
...
Well, I knew me a boy, and yes he was a friend
I told him him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been calling my name
'Cause I found me a better friend in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best friend that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna hang, but they never wanna leave
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's
...
Are you ready? ha
It's time for me to take it
I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
Cause this is my game
And you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back
Now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Yeah I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave
(Oh oh, oh) So you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had me underrated
Rated, rated
...
Run away, away with me (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Lost souls and reverie, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Running wild and running free (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Two kids, you and me, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
And I say hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades (ooh)
Renegades (ooh)
Long live the pioneers (da da da, da da da, da da da)
...
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even
Care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner over here just where I wanna
With this boy who's hollerin', I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna hang with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
...
It's a little crazy hoe the whole thing started.
I don't even really know what you intended.
Thought that you were cute,
And you could make me jealous.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
Next thing that I know,
I'm hanging out there with you.
You were talking deep,
Like it was mad love to you.
Ypu wanted my heart,
But I just felt so confused.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
And now I don't understand it,
You don't mess with love,
...
I went to the moped store
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder...
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever
Think of me
...
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
So take a look what you've done
And baby now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinkin' that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Saltin' the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
...
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Yo, yes I'll be your favorite, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes I'll be whatever, just you tell me when you ready
Yes I'll be your girl forever you baby
You ain't ever gotta worry I'm here for you baby, oh
Best believe that when you need that
I'll sing that, you will always hear it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that I'ma let you hear it
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey mama, mama, hey mama, mama
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Yeah, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Yeah, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Ok, just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'm a call your bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front
Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
"Ooh I love your style"
Uh huh show me how you dance
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh see me in the spotlight
"Ooh I love your style"
Uh huh show me how you dance
Come and make it worth my while
...
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one chance
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
...
Need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
...
Come on
Kidz bop kids (yeah)
I wanna rock with somebody (whoa, yeah)
I wanna just dance with somebody (dance, dance, dance, dance)
I wanna rock with somebody (somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gonna leave nobody, we ain't gonna leave nobody (nobody)
Why can't everybody know what's good
'Cause some gon' hate what's new
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool
And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we go home?
Oh, no, we won't
We never go home, we never go home
And when they try to make us leave we turn and say we never going home (home)
And you know just what I wanna do
...
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, you're the one
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
...
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh oh
Keep you like an oath
May nothing but this do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Talk to me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench
The stench
Of sunny heads
It ends through eternity
Oh yeah yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
With your, with you
Venom in me
...
Hey Kids, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Hey, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh, look out!
Kidz Bop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer things (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues
Ooh yeah
I'm a dangerous one with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty ones around me and they know just how to talk it (Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
...
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
...
Mmmm... yeah... mm... yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm... yeah... uh... mm... yeah, yeah
Listen
Baby I just don't get it (get it)
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories (stories)
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are), whoo
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby girl, good love and protection
Make me your selection
I'll show you
...
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
Crazy
And the more I think, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you
Do you think of me?
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends're all acting strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
...
That's my girl
Yeah, who's been working so so hard?
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this stress out body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad?
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder
Then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
...
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I talk too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty but you are so far
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer as we stand against Rover
That I know they can't afford
Brush that stress right off your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the notebook that you stole
From your friends way back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
...
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of look you're wearing tonight
If he's holding on your hands so tight
The way I did before
I overlooked
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
...
Why wait to say
At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move
And it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
...
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and hold her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
...
I, was the knight in shining armor in your movie
We put your hand in mine and love the afterthought now
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I just can't concentrate
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that thing is broken, that thing is broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
(Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low)
...
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth
Don't care what you say to me, I'ma bite the feelings out (gold up in my teeth)
I missed it in the basement (gold up in my teeth)
Running on the pavement (gold up in my teeth)
And if you love me, love me but you never let me go
When the roof is on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth)
...
Walking there to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
If the whole world was watching, I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mm-mm-mm
...
I stay up too late
Got nothin' in my brain
And that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
...
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Yo, yes I'll be your favorite, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes I'll be whatever, just you tell me when you ready
Yes I'll be your girl forever you baby
You ain't ever gotta worry I'm here for you baby, oh
Best believe that when you need that
I'll sing that, you will always hear it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that I'ma let you hear it
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey mama, mama, hey mama, mama
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
...
I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need you here, here
I need you now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna here with your love
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta see you in that place
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and dance away with me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good dancing
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar
...
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my other
Move on
You watch me run until I can't breathe (whoo), shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself (whoo), aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you pulled me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your beating heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
...
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in heavens knows I've tried
Don't let them in
...
Hey Kids, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
Hey, what y'all trying to do?
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe soul player
Uh, look out!
Kidz Bop, it's show time (Show time)
Show time (Show time)
Guess who's back again?
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
I bet they know soon as we walk in (Showin' up)
Wearing Cuban links (ya)
Designer things (ya)
Inglewood's finest shoes (Whoop, whoop)
Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues
Ooh yeah
I'm a dangerous one with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty ones around me and they know just how to talk it (Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
...
Uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
Well, oh, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I see another mountain to climb
But I, I got stamina
And uh-oh, I need another love to be mine
Cause I, I got stamina
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
Don't give up; I won't give up
Don't give up, no no no
I'm free to be the greatest, I'm alive
I'm free to be the greatest here tonight, the greatest
The greatest, the greatest alive
The greatest, the greatest alive
Well, uh-oh, running out of breath, but I
Oh, I, I got stamina
Uh-oh, running now, I close my eyes
But, oh, I got stamina
And oh yeah, running to the waves below
...
Mmmm... yeah... mm... yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm... yeah... uh... mm... yeah, yeah
Listen
Baby I just don't get it (get it)
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories (stories)
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are), whoo
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby girl, good love and protection
Make me your selection
I'll show you
...
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
Crazy
And the more I think, the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you
Do you think of me?
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends're all acting strange
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
...
That's my girl
Yeah, who's been working so so hard?
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this stress out body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad?
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder
Then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
...
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I talk too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty but you are so far
And I can't stop
No, I can't stop
So baby pull me closer as we stand against Rover
That I know they can't afford
Brush that stress right off your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the notebook that you stole
From your friends way back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
...
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of look you're wearing tonight
If he's holding on your hands so tight
The way I did before
I overlooked
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
...
Why wait to say
At least I did it my way
Lie awake, two-faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move
And it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
My way
Oh way, oh way, oh way
...
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and hold her woes away
'Cause cover girls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
...
I, was the knight in shining armor in your movie
We put your hand in mine and love the afterthought now
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I just can't concentrate
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that thing is broken, that thing is broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
(Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low)
...
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth
Don't care what you say to me, I'ma bite the feelings out (gold up in my teeth)
I missed it in the basement (gold up in my teeth)
Running on the pavement (gold up in my teeth)
And if you love me, love me but you never let me go
When the roof is on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show
And I could leave the party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know
Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth (gold up, gold up in my teeth)
...
Walking there to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now
If the whole world was watching, I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mm-mm-mm
...
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've bought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home, I'll be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
As long as you love me so
...
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet
Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
...
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
...
Ooh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
...
You know Dasher and Dancer,
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid,
And Donner and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Reindeer)
...
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
...
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Christmas carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la
...
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
...
Bah Humbug; now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
...
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Oh, Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
...
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
...
Out of all the reindeers you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
Said Santa to a boy child what have you been longing for?
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
...
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye
Ooh
...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
...
Yeah, hmm
Ah yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (just imagine, just imagine)
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, dancing here with you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I saying to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
...
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
...
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's friday night and it won't be long
'Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills
To have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
...
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize
Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
"I'd sing for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A song for them, a song for you
A song for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many songs coming through
See many songs coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
...
I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
...
Telling me this
And telling me that
You said once you take me with you, I'll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya
I'mma show you that where you from don't matter to me
She said, "Hola. ¿Cómo estás?" She said, "Konnichiwa."
She said, "Pardon my French," I said, "Bonjour, Madame."
...
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
Who's that pretty girl I see over there
That's me, standing in the mirror
What's that icy thing hanging around my neck
That's gold
Show me some respect, ah
I thank God every day (uh-huh)
That I woke up feeling this way (uh-huh)
And I can't help loving myself
And I don't nobody else, nah uh
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
...
Everybody gets sad sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be sad on your own
And if you feel you're sinking,
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
...
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes,
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely"
And ever since that day...
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy," they say to me,
"Away from all of reality"
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
...
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
...
I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you like him too
Am I crazy, have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it
I turn my chin music up
And I'm buffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me a mess
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be jealous
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too pretty, beautiful
And everybody likes you too
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
' You're too pretty, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
I wish you didn't have to post it all
...
If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't chanched
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say
Money ain't a thing club jumping like kidz bop now yeah dance with me we're going around homie we about to clown why 'cause its about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
End of the day, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
...
Yeah, hmm
Ah yeah
I got this feeling inside my bones

She said, "Hola. ¿Cómo estás?" She said, "Konnichiwa."
She said, "Pardon my French," I said, "Bonjour, Madame."
...
I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh
Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform
When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time,"
...
Who's that pretty girl I see over there
That's me, standing in the mirror
What's that icy thing hanging around my neck
That's gold
Show me some respect, ah
I thank God every day (uh-huh)
That I woke up feeling this way (uh-huh)
And I can't help loving myself
And I don't nobody else, nah uh
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
...
Everybody gets sad sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be sad on your own
And if you feel you're sinking,
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
...
There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes,
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely"
And ever since that day...
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy," they say to me,
"Away from all of reality"
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
I still mess up but I'll just start again
I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
I always get up now to see what's next
Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
I wanna try even though I could fail
I won't give up, no I won't give in
'Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
...
Ahahahahahahahaha
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna bring it tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
...
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
So take a look what you've done
And baby now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinkin' that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Saltin' the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
...
Boys and girls of every age

Pretending you got a sliver
But you're not fooling me 'cause I can see
The way you shake and shiver
You know we got a mystery to solve
...
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
On my life, on my head (don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
...
Ooh

It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's
Here come the Men In Black
(Men In Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me, MIB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't brink be what was there is now gone
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
(Ooh, ooh)
'Cause you never quite know where the MIB's is at
Uh, eh
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
Galaxy defenders
Oho oho oho
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
They won't let you remember
(Won't let you remember)
Aha, aha
Now, from the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like boom black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
...
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you
I told the witch doctor

(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
...
Hey! Yeah!

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
They caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
...
Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
...
Little shop, little shoppa horrors
Little shop, little shoppa terror
Call a cop, little shoppa horrors
No, oh, oh, no-oh!
Little shop, little shoppa horrors
Bop sh-bop, little shoppa terror
Watch 'em drop, little shoppa horrors
No, oh, oh, no-oh!
Shing-a-ling, what a creepy thing
To be happenin'
...
Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-eee"
It looks like a purple eater to me
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough"
...
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But the evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet this devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
...
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got a bit surprised late last night
Werewolves of London again
...
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
...
What do you mean? Oooh
When you sometimes say yes
But you sometimes say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, hanging out all night.
First you up and you're down and then between
...
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my other
Move on
You watch me run until I can't breathe (whoo), shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself (whoo), aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you pulled me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your beating heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
...
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as well
He's so good, and he knows it too well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in the air, he looks across the room
...
I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
...
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Anytime you needed to talk
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city
You started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
...
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said
I know I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget
You know I don't believe, I don't believe it You left in peace, left me in pieces
To hard to breath
I'm on my knees right know, oh
I'm so sick of that same old love
That love it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
My heart has had enough
Ohh (That same old love)
Ohh (That same old love)
I'm not spending any time
Wasting tonight on you
I know I've heard it all so don't you try and change your mind
...
Well, I knew me a boy, and yes he was a friend
I told him him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been calling my name
'Cause I found me a better friend in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best friend that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna hang, but they never wanna leave
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's
...
Ah ah
Ah ah
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing you, and now I'm sorry, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
...
Are you ready? ha
It's time for me to take it
I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
Cause this is my game
And you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back
Now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Yeah I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave
(Oh oh, oh) So you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had me underrated
Rated, rated
...
Run away, away with me (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Lost souls and reverie, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Running wild and running free (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Two kids, you and me, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
And I say hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades (ooh)
Renegades (ooh)
Long live the pioneers (da da da, da da da, da da da)
...
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even
Care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner over here just where I wanna
With this boy who's hollerin', I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna hang with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
...
It's a little crazy hoe the whole thing started.
I don't even really know what you intended.
Thought that you were cute,
And you could make me jealous.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
Next thing that I know,
I'm hanging out there with you.
You were talking deep,
Like it was mad love to you.
Ypu wanted my heart,
But I just felt so confused.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
And now I don't understand it,
You don't mess with love,
...
I went to the moped store
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder...
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever
Think of me
...
Walking round with my head down
But I can't hide with these new shoes on
Downtown in a thick crowd
But it's just you that my mind is on
Dressed up, got my heart messed up
You got yours and I got mine
It's unfair that I still care
And I wonder where you are tonight
Thinking it could be different
But maybe we missed it yea
Thinking it could be different
It could, it could
It should've been us
Shoulda been a fire, shoulda been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Coulda been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure, ooh
We were crazy, but amazing, baby we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us
Back and forth like a tug of war
What's it all for, do I want it back
I still got a little flame for ya
Even though you drove me mad
...
I want you to breathe me in
Let me be in your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love
Is it like the ocean
What devotion are you
How deep is your love
Is it like nirvana
Singing harder again
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
Is it like the ocean
Pull me closer again
...
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got those dance moves that all the boys chase
All the right moves in all the right places
I see the magazine (ah-ah) working that Photoshop (ah-ah)
You know that it ain't real, c'mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (ah-ah), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says, "Don't let it keep you at home in your room at night"
(Don't do it, do it, uh, don't do it)
You know I won't be no stick figure fake plastic Barbie doll
...
Yeah
C'mon Kids Bop
Let's go
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off (eh, eh, eh)
What you got,
A billion could've never bought (eh, eh, eh)
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you,
When the music makes you move
...
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your one and only
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
...
I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
...
(Ho!)
(Hey!)
(Ho!) I've been trying to do it right
(Hey!) I've been living a lonely life
(Ho!) I've been sleeping here instead
(Hey!) I've been sleeping in my bed,
(Ho!) I've been sleeping in my bed
Sleeping in my bed (Hey!)
(Ho!)
(Ho!) So show me family
(Hey!) All the love that I will need
(Ho!) I don't know where I belong
(Hey!) I don't know where I went wrong
(Ho!) But I can write a song
...
What do you mean? Oooh
When you sometimes say yes
But you sometimes say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.
Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, hanging out all night.
First you up and you're down and then between
...
I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my other
Move on
You watch me run until I can't breathe (whoo), shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself (whoo), aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses (whoo)
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you pulled me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your beating heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
...
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as well
He's so good, and he knows it too well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ah
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in the air, he looks across the room
...
I've got fire for a heart
I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
...
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Anytime you needed to talk
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city
You started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
...
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said
I know I've heard it all before at least a million times
I'm not one to forget
You know I don't believe, I don't believe it You left in peace, left me in pieces
To hard to breath
I'm on my knees right know, oh
I'm so sick of that same old love
That love it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love
My heart has had enough
Ohh (That same old love)
Ohh (That same old love)
I'm not spending any time
Wasting tonight on you
I know I've heard it all so don't you try and change your mind
...
Well, I knew me a boy, and yes he was a friend
I told him him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been calling my name
'Cause I found me a better friend in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best friend that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna hang, but they never wanna leave
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like ghosts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's
...
Ah ah
Ah ah
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing you, and now I'm sorry, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
...
Are you ready? ha
It's time for me to take it
I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it
Not when you go down
Cause this is my game
And you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back
Now I'm letting go
I make my own choice
Yeah I run this show
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave
(Oh oh, oh) So you say I'm complicated
That I must be outta my mind
But you've had me underrated
Rated, rated
...
Run away, away with me (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Lost souls and reverie, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Running wild and running free (da da da, da da da, da da da)
Two kids, you and me, hey (da da da, da da da, da da da)
And I say hey, hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Living like we're renegades
Renegades (ooh)
Renegades (ooh)
Long live the pioneers (da da da, da da da, da da da)
...
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listening, or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even
Care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner over here just where I wanna
With this boy who's hollerin', I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna hang with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I asked myself, "What am I doin' here?"
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
...
It's a little crazy hoe the whole thing started.
I don't even really know what you intended.
Thought that you were cute,
And you could make me jealous.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
Next thing that I know,
I'm hanging out there with you.
You were talking deep,
Like it was mad love to you.
Ypu wanted my heart,
But I just felt so confused.
Kept it down,
So I kept it down.
And now I don't understand it,
You don't mess with love,
...
I went to the moped store
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder...
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever
Think of me
...
Oh, no
See you walking round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, yeah; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, ah
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
Its a life that's meant to be, its a life that's meant to be
But you're moving so carefully; you're not living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk with me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you be Naomi - whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
...
I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
First you gonna say you ain't runnin'
Game, thinkin' I'm believing every word
Call me beautiful, so original, telling me I'm not like other girls
I was in my zone before you came
Along, now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the I, to the no, no, no
All my ladies listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl all you gotta say is

You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no
My name is no
My sign is no

...
This is how we do, KIDZ BOP!
It's my house, come on, turn it up
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
'Cause we done this before so you all come in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Play a song something good, come on, dance to this
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what it is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
Welcome to my house
Come on, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me how you dance now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
...
For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm crying on my own. Well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't,
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back,
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job,
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know,
I'm better leaving on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
...
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body told me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of ya dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm! but I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fit
Work work work work work work
He said me haffi
Work work work work work work
...
I used to be so happy
But without here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I'll never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you'll always be by my side till the day I die
Till the day I die
Funny how we both end happy but everything seems alright, ooh
I wonder what will happen
If we went back and put up a fight
...
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were sitting on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
...
Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a Another
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
...
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
...
I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game mm, mm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
...
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
...
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely."
Once I was eleven years old
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
...
One dance kidz bop
Baby, I like your style.
Dance face to face this way to that way.
You know that I don't play.
Street's not safe, but i'll never run away--even when i'm away.
Oh yeah oh yeah.
There's never much love when we run away.
I pray we make it back in one piece.
I pray i pray.
Thats why i need a one dance.
Couple your hands in my hands.
One more dance 'fore i go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.(
Sing twice)
...
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your backpack and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-others
They'll tell you I'm to blame
...
I don't mind
Letting you down easy but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Ain't it good
Being all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you
...
Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah
'Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? Say yes, say yes
'Cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing till the day I die
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too
Why you gotta be so rude
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude
...
I'm not nervous I'm not scared I feel the energy in the air.
Inside I'm ready I feel so cool and I bet you feel it too!
Well my heart skips, skips a beat, and I don't care what you see I'll take my
Chance on breaking it down and going all out right now now now and I'll be the Life Of The Party I'll take that one first step and the rest is history turn up
The beat and get started I'm gonna move my feet like the day was made for me.

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good.
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
...
Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a Another
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
...
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
...
I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it on, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm
We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game mm, mm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
...
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
...
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me,
"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely."
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely."
Once I was eleven years old
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
...
One dance kidz bop
Baby, I like your style.
Dance face to face this way to that way.
You know that I don't play.
Street's not safe, but i'll never run away--even when i'm away.
Oh yeah oh yeah.
There's never much love when we run away.
I pray we make it back in one piece.
I pray i pray.
Thats why i need a one dance.
Couple your hands in my hands.
One more dance 'fore i go.
Higher powers taking a hold on me.(
Sing twice)
...
I'm not nervous I'm not scared I feel the energy in the air.
Inside I'm ready I feel so cool and I bet you feel it too!
Well my heart skips, skips a beat, and I don't care what you see I'll take my
Chance on breaking it down and going all out right now now now and I'll be the Life Of The Party I'll take that one first step and the rest is history turn up

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
So take a look what you've done
And baby now we got bad blood, hey
Did you have to do this?
I was thinkin' that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me?
Where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Saltin' the wound like you're laughin' right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times you and I
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
...
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Be my only girl, I'll (be your one)
Yo, yes I'll be your favorite, yes, I'll be your baby
Yes I'll be whatever, just you tell me when you ready
Yes I'll be your girl forever you baby
You ain't ever gotta worry I'm here for you baby, oh
Best believe that when you need that
I'll sing that, you will always hear it
I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that I'ma let you hear it
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey mama, mama, hey mama, mama
Bang in the drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
...
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are singing
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like leaving?
I'm like no, not really 'cause
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
...
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Yeah, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it
Yeah, I'm worth it
Uh huh I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Ok, just gimme you, just gimme you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do
And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
I may talk a lot of stuff
Guaranteed, I can back it up
I think I'm a call your bluff
Hurry up, I'm waitin' out front
Uh huh, you see me in the spotlight
"Ooh I love your style"
Uh huh show me how you dance
'Cause I don't wanna waste my time
Uh huh see me in the spotlight
"Ooh I love your style"
Uh huh show me how you dance
Come and make it worth my while
...
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one chance
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
...
Need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
...
Come on
Kidz bop kids (yeah)
I wanna rock with somebody (whoa, yeah)
I wanna just dance with somebody (dance, dance, dance, dance)
I wanna rock with somebody (somebody, come on, come on)
And we ain't gonna leave nobody, we ain't gonna leave nobody (nobody)
Why can't everybody know what's good
'Cause some gon' hate what's new
We just do our thing, no time to waste
Always play it cool
And at the end of the night when the lights go out, will we go home?
Oh, no, we won't
We never go home, we never go home
And when they try to make us leave we turn and say we never going home (home)
And you know just what I wanna do
...
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go
Blow a kiss, you're the one
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
All we need is somebody to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, you're the one
...
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh oh
Keep you like an oath
May nothing but this do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Talk to me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench
The stench
Of sunny heads
It ends through eternity
Oh yeah yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
With your, with you
Venom in me
...
Drive you insane
Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play, letting my life get away
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
...
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
...
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurtsI don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh

Billionaire bottles, we just down em like

I'm not sure just what you heard
But I know a simple trick
You put both hands up clap them above
Do it do it just like this
I think I might have got the dancing sickness
Never ever had a fever like this
But where's the fun of being normal anywhere
Ok 5 4 3 2 1
I feel like turning it up
Breaking it down
Jump on my feet don't touch the ground
You got a voice you got a choice
Come on get loud let's make some noise
Sing it like
Oooooooooh oooooooooh
This is the time it's you and I
Let's get lalalala loud
...
Kidz Bop, you set it off
Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up
The night is hazy
Let's get lost on the dance floor
Somewhere we can go
And everyone can find
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Oh my my, feeling like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna live tonight
Oh my my, hook you with a brand new vibe
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun
Fresh from Monaco
Performing for Microsoft
Miami to L.A., G4, we takin' off
I'm a hard worker, I'm far from the boss
...
Yo, tonight is the night that I'ma gonna fix it
Gimme a song and a voice, I'ma mix it
Like a spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time
The night is still young
...
My house in Budapest
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo
You
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all
My acres of a land
That I've achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe
But for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all
Oh, for you
Ooh, you
Ooh, I'd leave it all
Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
Baby if you hold me
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
...
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
...

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time.
Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style
...
I knew the rent was gon' be late 'bout a week ago
You worked your tail off
You still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
(Kidz bop kidz)
Let's get it now
This is the last $20 I got
But I'mma have a good time dancin' or out
Tell my friends, line up some spots
'Cause I'mma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Sounds like Mariah, she sang it from the top
Told her to sing, sing, sing, sing it like it's hot
...
I know what you came here to see
If you can dance, then ya dancing here with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now come on over let me see you just
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
You girls dressed to twirl
I do hot tricks (?)
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these hands in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, but oh me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave yeah
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your smile on my mind, I miss you bad
Oh just the thought of you makes my heart fly
So high
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to be right next to you
Girl you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl you got me
There's nothing I, no I wouldn't do (I wouldn't do)
Just to be right next to you
...
Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?
I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I'll be watching you, oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside, oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside, oh
...
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
...
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course
I'm slippin down a chain reaction
And here I go here I go here I go go
And once again I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down pulls me down pulls me down low
Honey it's raining tonight
But storms always have an eye have an eye
Tell me you're covered tonight
Or tell me lies tell me lies lies
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
...
Dear future husband,
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you wanna be
My one and only all my life
Take me on a date
I deserve a bae
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries
Buy-buying what you need
You got that 9 to 5
But, baby, so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking apple pies
I never learned to cook
But I can write a Sing along with me
Sing-sing along with me (hey)
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
...
Du du du-du, du du du-du
Du du du-du, du du du-du
Du du...
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
He-e-e-ey ya, oh he-e-e-ey
He-e-e-ey ya
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong
The story's all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
The feelings on your mind like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Du du du-du, du du du-du
Du du du-du, du du du-du
Du du...
...
I think I've had enough
It might get a little tough
I say what's on my mind
I might do it every time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm 4, 5 seconds from wildin'
And we got 3 more days til' Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me. Ooh that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
The sun was shinin' I'm positive (wakin' up)
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
(It's a mystery)
Hold me back, I'm bout to crash
...
Nah nah, honey, I'm good
I could stay a while but I probably should not
I've got somebody back home
(Home, home, home, home)
It's been a long night here
And a long night there
And these long, long days, oh they're everywhere
Hold up now, you seem nice
I will not lie, but if you ask what I'm doing tonight
I gotta be like
Ah baby, nah baby
You got me all wrong baby
My baby's already got all of my love
So nah nah, honey, I'm good
I could stay a while but I probably should not
I've got somebody back home
And I should really call them on the phone
Nah nah, honey, I'm good
I could stay a while but I probably should not
I've got to bid you adieu
...
I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be
Tamed, never be tamed, never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I got a way of knowing when something is right, aha yeah
I feel like I must have known you in another life, another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I stu-stu-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breath, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being funny"
...
I was a liar
I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar (come on)
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who walks you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
...
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream
Oh, oh, and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the far side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
...
Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight
I should be more cynical and tell myself it's not okay
(To feel happy when I'm with you)
I try my best to fight it, say I hate it but I always stay
Woah, woah, woah cause
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you do
Ain't nobody love, ain't nobody love like you-oo-oo-oo do

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
...
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs.
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
...
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel?
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blew from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Yeah, put under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite
The light and let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go
Oh, oh, oh
As you shoot across the sky
'Cause baby, you're a firework
...
I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh, my gosh
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get rocked
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov!
Look at her dancing, just dance along
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
Let's do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
'Cause I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
...
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like gold teeth, gold goose, singin' in the bathroom
Grass stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like gold ring, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of love
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
...
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in heavens knows I've tried
Don't let them in
...
I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need you here, here
I need you now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging
I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna here with your love
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta see you in that place
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and dance away with me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good dancing
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar
...
Tonight, you come and pick me up
No headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, it's been a while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go round and round each time
You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time.
Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style
...
I knew the rent was gon' be late 'bout a week ago
You worked your tail off
You still can't pay it though

Told her to sing, sing, sing, sing it like it's hot
...
I know what you came here to see
If you can dance, then ya dancing here with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now come on over let me see you just
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
You girls dressed to twirl
I do hot tricks (?)
Shake for a shake
I'm throwing these hands in the sky
Spinning this As-salamu alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard and high tide
...
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my love
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing that means so much
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been that shy
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
What are you waiting for?
...
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, but oh me
And I can't take it no more, it's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave yeah
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your smile on my mind, I miss you bad
Oh just the thought of you makes my heart fly

Fire's out, what do you want to be?
I'm holding on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day I'll be watching you, oh
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me"
We were victims of the night
The quizzical, mystical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This girl, she is my destiny

I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course
I'm slippin down a chain reaction
And here I go here I go here I go go
And once again I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down pulls me down pulls me down low
Honey it's raining tonight
But storms always have an eye have an eye
Tell me you're covered tonight
Or tell me lies tell me lies lies
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your backpack and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-others
They'll tell you I'm to blame
...
I don't like the way he's looking at you
I'm starting to think you like him too
Am I crazy, have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it
I turn my chin music up
And I'm buffing my chest
I'm getting red in the face
You can call me a mess
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be jealous
I still get jealous
'Cause you're too pretty, beautiful
And everybody likes you too
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
' You're too pretty, beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous
I wish you didn't have to post it all
...
Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
Is that the problom calling to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can't keep
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
...
Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the good times, take it with the bad
And if in the moment I think of it
Baby, in that moment you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me, you gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Baby, love me harder
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh,
Love me, love me, love me,
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh,
Love me, love me, love me

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Left out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The world's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons
Why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
The heart wants what it wa-a-a-a-a-nts
...
We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
...
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
...
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But the evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet this devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these troubles away
...
My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time (time) you are not around
I'm slowly drifting (away, drifting away)
Wave after wave (wave after wave)
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm falling
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the wave
Drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting, drifting away)
(Drifting, drifting away)
...
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the look of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
...
I stay up too late
Got nothin' in my brain
And that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, hmm-mm
That's what people say, hmm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be all right"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
...
Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got those dance moves that all the boys chase
All the right moves in all the right places
I see the magazine (ah-ah) working that Photoshop (ah-ah)
You know that it ain't real, c'mon now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (ah-ah), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size
She says, "Don't let it keep you at home in your room at night"
(Don't do it, do it, uh, don't do it)
You know I won't be no stick figure fake plastic Barbie doll
...
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold
Remember my name, 'bout to blow
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it, depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much
That they give that line a rewind
...
Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
You're picture blue
Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a it was
Under your influence
You take me over you're the magic in my veins
This must be love
Boom! Clap!
The sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom! Clap!
You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom! Clap!
The sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom! Clap!
You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
...
Saturday morning jumped out of bed and put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet, all the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man yeah yeah
'Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? Say yes, say yes
'Cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing till the day I die
Tough luck my friend but the answer is no!
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too
Why you gotta be so rude
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude
...
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So am I wrong?
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
Am I crazy for having a vision?
My prediction: I'ma be on the top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
...
I miss the taste of the sweet life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
...
Never
Never
Never
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around (never)
If there are problems, I will try to knock them down (never)
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found (never)
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
Now I've got love in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got love caught up in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)
...
If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
...
She sees them walking in a straight line
That's not really her style
They all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could
Ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible
And she's just in the background
And she says
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids
They seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids
He sees them talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
...
I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feeling as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
Cause I can't get you out my mind
Thinkin of ya when I'm goin to bed
When I wake up think of ya again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever your around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well your the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower
Ladade ladada ladada
Singing in the shower
Ladade ladada ladada
Singing in the shower
...
Ooh, oh-oh
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so causally
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
...
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I, I'm feeling so small
It was over my head
...
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
...
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
...
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
...
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greetings
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
...
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
...
Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes around on a special night?
Santa comes around on a special night
Special Night, beard that's white
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus
Who wears boots and a suit of red?
Santa wears boots and a suit of red
Who wears a long cap on his head?
Santa wears a long cap on his head
Cap on head, suit that's red
Special night, beard that's white
Must be Santa
Must be Santa
Must be Santa, Santa Claus
...
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
...
Up on the house top reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
First comes of stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa, fill it well
Give her a dollie that laughs and cries
One that will open and shut her eyes
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the house top, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
...
Bah Humbug; now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
...
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
...
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
...
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning
Oh they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
They sailed into Bethlehem
...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
...
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a snowman
Okay, bye
Ooh
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a day, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Not just me and i have't chanched
Live in hotels flying on planes, blessed to say
Money ain't a thing club jumping like kidz bop now yeah dance with me we're going around homie we about to clown why 'cause its about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
End of the day, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the day, it's going down
One more dance, another town
...
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your one and only
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
...
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the hallway she don't feel the same about us in her bones
Seems to me that when I go, these words will be written on my own
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I'm by her side to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend my love until I'm broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
...
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-eh-oh, eh-oh
I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show
And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
...
It's late in the evening
I'm on the side now
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could just talk now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
So everybody knows
Take another step so that you understand
To the end of time, lady
I need you darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling, won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
If you love me come on let me know
Feel the music move you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
Oh-ooh, oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing
...
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
Yeah we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
Just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
By doing the right thing
I feel something so right
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't I, couldn't lie
Everything that moves me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, "No more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
...
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out x15
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancing around the words we tell
Dancing around big eyes as well
Even the kids in here they don't dance and tell
...
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ife
...
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you're hearing me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's underwater but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your words and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
...
Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday? Uh
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
And then they turn right around and break them
When someone breaks your heart
Open with a light and you're hurting
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it, so
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might look around and find
Your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money
Just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
...
I don't mind
Letting you down easy but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, but just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
Ain't it fun
Living in the real world
Ain't it good
Being all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want
See it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you
...
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I, I'm felling so small
It was over my head, I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
...
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in heavens knows I've tried
Don't let them in
...
Dog goes woof, cat goes meow.
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak.
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot.
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes OW OW OW.
But there's one sound that no one knows...
WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY?

...
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
...
Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (wow)
Just like she already owned it
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oh (Whoo!)
Said her name was Georgia Rose (wow)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a crooked smile (I got a crooked smile)
But she said it like she meant it
...
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we fall 'cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I lost in you again
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
...
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
...
Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
(Oh, whoa-oh-oh)
I know that you don't know it, but you're kind, so kind (kind, so kind)
(Oh, whoa-oh-oh)
Oh girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
And if you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
...
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like gold teeth, gold goose, singin' in the bathroom
Grass stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like gold ring, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of love
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
...
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying is it right or is it wrong
If only fame had its own key baby could i bear
Being away from you i found a way to get you here
I live for the applause applause applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause applause applause
Give me the thing that i love (I'll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)
Give me the thing that i love, love (I'll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)
A-p-p-l-a-u-s-e
(Make it real loud)
Put you hands up make 'em touch, touch
(A-p-p-l-a-u-s-e)
A-p-p-l-a-u-s-e
(Make it real loud)
Put you hands up make 'em touch, touch
(A-p-p-l-a-u-s-e)
...
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
...
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard fact for you to swallow, yeah
But if I fall for you
I'll never recover
If I fall for you
I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But it takes me all the way
It takes me all the way
I really wanna love somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But it takes me all the way
It takes me all the way
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
...
Can't count the years one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And, baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
...
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so good
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath everytime I pass your door
I know your there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you fell the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
...
I've got my ticket for the long way 'round
Two bottle whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I'm leaving tomorrow. What d'you say?
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me by my hair
You're gonna miss me everywhere, oh
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
...
I can't lift you up I can show you what you want
To see and take you where you want to be you
Can be my luck
Even if the sky is falling down
I know that we'll be safe and sound
We're safe and sound
I could fill your cup
You know my river won't evaporate
This world we still appreciate
You could be my luck
Even in a hurricane of frowns
I know that we'll be safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
We're safe and sound
Hold your ground
We're safe and sound
Safe and sound
...

Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up really big, beauty queen style
New shoes on, I'm feeling alive
Oh, my gosh, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above, are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I see it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
Listen hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-S-Summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh
...
Dog goes woof, cat goes meow.
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak.
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot.
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes OW OW OW.
But there's one sound that no one knows...

See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
...
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful

Why you actin' so shy? Holdin' back, holdin' back

Light it up, light it up, so explosive
You're crazy girl (yeah yeah)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
...
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what
What, what, what what

I'm gonna rock some tags, only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up, this is really awesome
Now walk up to the club like "What up? I got a hit song"
I'm so pumped, I bought some clothes from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so so frosty
The people like "Hey, the guy on the marquee!"
Rolling in super deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like my baseball cleats
(Ewww) But hey, it was 99 cents
Bag it, poppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, wear it man, I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm super happy, that's a bargain, yeah
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, "Can I have his hand-me-downs?" (Thank you!)
...
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she dances
We're so fly (we're so fly tonight)
And as long as I got my suit and tie

Long ways from the hard ways
Filled with "So"'s and "Oh, yeah"'s

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a summer day
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world, and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe
But she knows she can fly away
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
She got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
She got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
...
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs.
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
You drove your car across the bridge
I watched, you let it turn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
You drove your car across the bridge
I don't care, I love it
I don't care
...
Ay, ay, ay
Come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK
Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit
Get up! Fresh out, pimp strut walking,
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby.
Sweater gang, nope, nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking,
This here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it our way.
Grown music,
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down,
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pa the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T s hustler,
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing
Labels out here,
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country
...
Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said much to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair to make it bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Painting my nails and wear my heels
Yes, you make me so nervous, and I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
...
Aren't you something to admire
'Cause your shine is something like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel lonely
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (oh)
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger (oh, oh, oh, oh)
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
...
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, ah ah, ah ah.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To dance with kidz bop ah ah, ah ah.

We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you

But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh

This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights,

Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing person I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every talk you fixed them Now you've been talking out to me Things you never say to me
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Im sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Oh we had everything
Your head is running wild again

Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
...
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure,
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning (frowning)
But hey now (hey now), you know, girl (know girl),
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me (love me)

Haha
Uh!
Hey, boy you never had much game
Thought I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away, way, way

With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns
Uh!
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
Uh!

And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Wa-want you, want you back
Uh!
Please, this ain't even jealousy (Jealously)
...
Hey baby, won't you look my way
I can be your new addiction
Hey baby, what you gotta say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry someone and this happens all the time
I found out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my heart hurt
I could hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mamas always gotta back track
When everybody talks back
Hey honey you could be my love
...
Let's go

'Cause your love takes me to paradise
Yeah, your love takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
...
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart
I'm wide awake
How did I read the stars so wrong
I'm wide awake
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then
What I know now
Wouldn't dive in
Wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts
You made it so sweet
Till I woke up on
On the concrete
Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
...
Hey, girl, I'm waiting on ya, I'm waiting on ya
Come on, and let me take you out (out, out)
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the window's down (down, down)
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, and we know it too (know it too)
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool, so tonight
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy dancing in the sun
I know we only met, but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight, let's have fun, and live while we're young
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) and live while we're young
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tonight, let's have fun, and live while we're young
...
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of learning
When you teach me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I saw the energy of sunrise
I saw the word inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
...
Feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleep
Like a big deal
Your love pours down on me surround me
Like a waterfall
...
Mmmm... yeah... mm... yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm... yeah... uh... mm... yeah, yeah
Listen
Baby I just don't get it (get it)
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories (stories)
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are), whoo
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby girl, good love and protection
Make me your selection
I'll show you
...
Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, no, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know anymore
(Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh)
This is it, boys, this is war (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
What are we waiting for? (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
Why don't we break the rules already? (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
I was never one to believe the hype (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked (oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh)
But here they come again to jack my style
...
I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go
I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only when it's driver
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better but I had to get to the showers
Face just showered, the minute in an hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil' mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents you're next
Give them my regards or regardless I get the best
Ain't worried about the leaders just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no, I can't stop I was destined
I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go, go, go, go
...
I'm staring out into the night
Tryna hide the pain
Going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel is a different kind of pain
I'm going home
Back to the place where I belong
Where love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
These places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home
Miles are getting longer it seems

Up on the house top reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys
First comes of stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa, fill it well
Give her a dollie that laughs and cries
One that will open and shut her eyes
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Ho-ho-ho, who wouldn't go?
Up on the house top, click, click, click
Down through the chimney with old St. Nick
...
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
...
Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes around on a special night?

Special Night, beard that's white

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there is a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells (silver bells), silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmastime in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling), hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of streetlights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
...
Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow
Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greetings
From relatives you don't know
Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
...
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful time of the year
It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all
There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
...
Bah Humbug; now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
...
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning
Oh they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
They sailed into Bethlehem
...

You know Dasher and Dancer,
And Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid,
And Donner and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Reindeer)
...
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
...
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
With cold kiss from Santa
You'll tie tigger
With Dancer and Prancer
Go, go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the mistletoe
Til we drop!
Dancin' all night
Lets go baby go go go.
Here's my favorite holiday,
My favorite time of year.
With cards we write,
A Christmas lights all wrapped
With Christmas cheer.
Gifts we give are memories
Will make it fall someday
We wish we had our history
When troubles go away
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
...
Ahahahahahahahaha
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer thriller tonight, yeah
Ahahahahahahahaha
I'm gonna bring it tonight
Ahahahahahahahaha
...
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
On my life, on my head (don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
...
Candy girl
My girls like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me
Candy girl
You are my world
You look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
When you're with me
You brighten up my day
All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through
The way you walk
And the way you talk
You always look so good
You make me forget my thoughts
(Do you really love me?) Do you really love me?
(Don't you really care?) Don't you really care?
(Do you really need me?) Do you really need me
...

I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets of SoHo in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fooks
Gonna get a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
Ah-hooo, werewolves of London
Ah-hooo
If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got a bit surprised late last night
Werewolves of London again

They're creepy and they're kooky
Mysterious and spooky
They're all together ooky
The Addams Family
Their house is a museum
Where people come to see-em

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
They caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash

Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We got some work to do now
Scooby Dooby Doo, where are you?
We need some help from you now
Come on Scooby Doo, I see you
Pretending you got a sliver
But you're not fooling me 'cause I can see
The way you shake and shiver
You know we got a mystery to solve
...
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy, you all know me I was scared as hell
He comes to me at night when I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside, he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake, but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare, on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten off of tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and down watch a movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I've never seen in my life
That was alright though, 'cause lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theatre set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent
You know, nothin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred
And this girl named Nancy
But, word! When it was over, I said, yo, that was def!
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, on my street
It was burnin' in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock, and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
...
Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
...
Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had the one long horn, one big eye
I commenced to shakin' and I said "ooh-eee"
It looks like a purple eater to me
It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (one eye?)
Well he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me
I heard him say in a voice so gruff
"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough"
...
Hey! Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
Ding-dong, the witch is dead
Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead
She's gone where the goblins go
Below, below, below Yo-ho
Let's open up and sing and ring the bells out
Ding-dong, the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead
Ding-dong, the witch is dead (yeah)
...
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
I know someone who's tough but sweet
Oh so fine, he can't be beat
He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
...
You know the life feels better,
Sitting here alone. sitting here alone
You know i'm dreaming color,
And do the things i want. do the things i want
Think you got the best of me.
Think you've had the last laugh.
But you think that everything good is gone.
Think you left me broken down.
Think that i'll come running back.
Maybe you don't know me cause you've been gone.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,
Stand a little taller,
Doesn't mean i'm lonely when i'm alone.
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter,
Footsteps even lighter,
Doesn't mean i'm loner cause you're gone.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger.
Just me, myself, and i.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,
...
I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way
I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where do you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
It's hard to look right
At you baby,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
And all the other boys,
Try to chase me,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
...
Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a thing, clink, have a good night
Good people like me, is hard to come by
The new tone, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'm gonna blow all my money and give into it
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more more, till I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
Can't stop, 'cause we're so fly
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up, and touch the sky
...
I'm feeling happy and free
Like glitter's raining on me
You're like a tone of your gut
I think I'm 'bout to explode
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there
Don't you know you spin me out of control
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can dance all night
Turn this club real tight
Baby, come on!
Feeling like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Rock the world until the sun lights
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Now were dancing in the moonlight
...
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
It's even harder to picture, that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it, but is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
...
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts, is here and now
My universe, will never be the same
I'm glad you came (came, came)
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I've decided this looks well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere I'd like you to see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another dance, dance it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away, away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make, make you glad you came
The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts, is here and now
My universe, will never be the same
I'm glad you came
...
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's deja vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
Or where ever to get away from me
Oh but that one day
Was more than OK
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as well
Because I really fell for you
Oh I swear to ya, I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
They move right through me
Oh I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
...
Days like this,
I want to drive away
Pack my bags
And watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up
And spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light
You drained me down
But that was then
And this is now
Now look at me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my soul.
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
...
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-c'mon
...
Dance, yes
Love, yes
Dance, yes
Love, yes
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid
So why should I hide
That I love to dance next to you baby
(Yeah come dance with me)
So many ways wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl got no secrets this time
Yeah I love to dance next to you baby
(Yeah come dance with me)
If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it do it do it)
Only got just one life this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say
(Let's do it do it do it)
...
If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag, swag, swag, on you
Chilling by the fire why we eating fondue
I dunno about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two swag
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, lemme talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
Never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
Never let you go, never let you go
...
I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleep
Like a big deal
Your love pours down on me surround me
Like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
...
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
...
I've been feeling real good (real good)
Came a long way from misunderstood (word)
Far away from the days where I wouldn't wanna go home
'Cause I was afraid of the truth
See I was scared to admit that failing was in the back of my head
Comes a point when lying no longer works so you have to stand up
For how you want to live
Tonight is the night is the night that we're losing control
Tonight is the night is the night we set it off
Everybody go
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everybody go
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ye-ye
...
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you hold my hands and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees, were far too weak
To stand, in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew, all the things you'd say
They were never true, never true and the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire, to the rain
Watched it pour as I, touched your face
Well it burn while I cried 'cause I heard it
Screaming out your name, your name
...
Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door; I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CD's
Rollin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' on a juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna act a little crazy (at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
California girls, we're unforgettable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
Sun-kissed beach, so hot, will melt your Popsicle
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
...
I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh, my gosh
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get rocked
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov!
Look at her dancing, just dance along
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
Let's do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
'Cause I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
...
I wanna be a billionaire so very bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the five and twenty's completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
...
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to the right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummys turnin' and I'm feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,

Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream
I knew when we collided,
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
...

Get that bodies rocking from side to side, side, side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back, back to life
Hands up and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body, ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life

Fire burning, Kidz Bop
Fire burning

Hotter than the sun in the south in Spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door
My hips started wiggling
The way she dance around that girl
Got me wanna dance with her all night
She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it, that birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire
Somebody call 911
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool it down
She wanna bring the roof to ground on the dance floor, whoa
...
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
She'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You, you belong with me
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
...
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another boy, he noticed me
I'm into him, he's into me
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears for three good years
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he's into it
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
...
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
...
Party rock, yeah
Woo
Let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (woo)
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
Party rock is in the house tonight (woo)

Let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight (woo)
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)

...
Oh, yeah
Oh!
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it OK
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue
And I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk
And I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
...
There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
And I got a reason that you're who should take me home tonight
I need a boy that thinks it's right to sing along
Tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby
Right on the limits where we know we both belong tonight
It's hard to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
...
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Girl I've been all over the world
Looking for you
I'm known for taking over that on the floor
And now I am overdue
And if you listen you can hear me through the radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missing in my life
What I been dreaming of
You'll be that girl
You'll be that girl
You'll be
Everything you want so let me get up there
I'm the best dancer in the atmosphere
Show me how you dance so we can move just how you like
You make me feel that
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You make me feel that
La la la la la
You make me feel so
La la la la la
You, you make me feel that
Get a little closer to me girl
...
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
I say, "Oh, got this feeling that you can't fight"
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life, a good, good life
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
...
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yea f**ked up, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
...
You took out a piece of me, and now I hurt internally
Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh, ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)
I can't believe that you wouldn't believe me
With all of your reasons
I lost my mind, you know I didn't mean it
And now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh
So there you go, oh
Can't make a life of it with you, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone
...
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
Dance a little stranger show me, where you've been?
...
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
...
If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
And keep you from walking out the door.
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds,
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
...
Summer right before school when we first met
We'd listen every day to radio head
And when it was my birthday you bought me some balloons
Used to eat your favorite ice cream and hang by the pool
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
...
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no I get a good feeling, yeah
Yes I can, doubt that I leave, I'm running with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January 1st, oh, you like that gossip
Like you the one thinking what gossip got done
Now I gotta work with your song
How many Rolling Stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit,
Speak it and it's done
...
You make me this, bring me up, bring me down
Playing sweet, make me move to the beat
Mr, Saxobeat makes me this, breaks me up, breaks me down
Playing sweet, make me move to the beat
Mr. Saxo, you make me this, bring me up, bring me down
Playing sweet, make me move to the beat
Mr. Saxo, he makes me this, breaks me up, breaks me down
Playing sweet, make me move to the beat
Mr. Saxobeat
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah
Oh, yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah, mm-yeah
...
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I been lookin' under rocks and breakin' locks
Just tryin' to find ya
I been like a maniac
Insomniac
5 steps behind ya
Tell them other girls
They can hit the exit
Check please
Cuz I finally found the girl of my dreams
Much more than a Grammy Award
That's how much you mean to me
You can be my it girl
Baby you're the it girl
Hang with me well be just fine
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl
You're bringing so much to my life
I just wanna dance all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it girl
You're my biggest hit girl
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
...
I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, happy now
I heard, that you're dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
...
Ow!!
This girls got your tongue tied in knots I see
Spit it out cause I'm dying for company
...
I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you, and forget her too
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that something? (Ain't that something?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a
Forget you
Now, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari
Hmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair
Ah, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh-oh, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know)
Ooh-ooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend
I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, forget you
...
Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first,
And the truth comes second,
Just stop for a minute and
Smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so so mysterious?
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to the left
Everybody look to the right
Can you feel that yeah?
Paying with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag
Ok, we need to take it back in time,
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't so low with bad videos
...
Oh, written in the stars, a million miles away
A message to the main oh, oh, oh
Seasons come and go but I will never change
And I am on my way
Lets go, yeah, you're listening now
They said they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my songs on so many different dials
'Cause I got more hits and I got more style
So when they see me everybody baraap baraap
Standing like a young gun fully backed and trapped
My criteria drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat so so berserk
So down to earth I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Mallory Black-man
(Where's all the world's sanity at?)
Man, I used to be the kid that no on cared about
...
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on
Throw my hands in the air
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lying on the couch just chilling in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the only man
Oh Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just take it slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
...
Uno, dos, tres
It's been a really really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dine but it's time for me to quit her
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter
La la la, oh well, la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
I woke up with a strange hair do
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter
...
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more and more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor
And you've been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure, with seconds left I show up
If you really want more (more), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor), bring out the fire
And light it up (up), take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give you more
...
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication, miscommunications lead to fall-out
Too many things that I wish you knew
So many walls that I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room, and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
...
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly (fly, fly, fly)
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows (knows)
Where we go we don't need roads (roads)
And where we stop nobody knows (knows)
To the stars if you really want it
Got, got a jet pack with your name on it
Above the clouds in the atmosphere ('phere)
Just say the words and we outta here (outta here)
Hold my hand if you feelin' scared (scared)
We flyin' up, up outta here
Here we go, come with me
There's a world out there that we should see
...
Wouldn't wanna be anybody else, hey
You made me insecure
Told 'em I wasn't good enough
But who are you to judge
When you're a diamond in the rough
I'm sure you got some things
You'd like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn't want to be anybody else
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
I'm no beauty queen
I'm just beautiful me
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na
You've got every night
To a beautiful life
Come on
Who says
Who says you're not perfect
Who says you're not worth it
Who says you're the only one that's hurting
Trust me
That's the price of beauty
Who says you're not pretty
...
Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
Just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while
You can never say never
While we don't know when
Time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
...
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
Hop up out the bed turn my swag on
Pay no attention to them haters 'cause we whip 'em off
And we ain't doing nothing wrong
So, don't tell me nothing, I'm just tryna have fun
So, keep the party jumping
So, what's up? (yeah)
And now they don't know what to do
We turn our back and whip our hair
And just shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Shake 'em off, shake 'em off
Don't let haters get me off my grind
With my hair, I know I'll be fine
Keep fighting until I get there
When I'm down and I feel like giving up
I think again
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (whip it real good)
I whip my hair back and forth
I whip my hair back and forth (just whip it)
...
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay it out bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
...
We both sit silent still, at the end of the night
Although we both sit close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you,
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say,
'Every rose has it's thorn'
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy,
Sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
(Yeah it does)
...
Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
...
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So, I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they're always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road
...
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through
I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you
...
1, 2, 3, 4
Hey (eh)
Forever
Hey (eh)
Forever
It's you, and me
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)
Tonight, is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music go 'round you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby We can go anywhere
Go anywhere
But first, it's your chance
Take my hand
Come with me
It's like I waited my whole life
For this one night
Its gon' be me you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun
And dance forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever (forever)
Ever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever on the dance floor
...
I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain, it's driving me crazy
We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby
Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way
Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over) yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over, and yesterday's just a memory
...
I can't tell you, baby, what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago, I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all
That's left are the wounds I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over, baby
Take some time, let me know if you really wanna go
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is
I did so wrong
Now I know what I got, it's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back, takes so long
I can't feel the things that cause you pain
...
Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh
Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up,
Make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you (beggin' you)
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
...
Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder even I know that
You made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages, no easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving, I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song today
...
Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last
Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame
...
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
Said woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
Mm, yeah
...
Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright
When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh
...
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
...
I guess the time was right for us to say
We'd take our time and live our lives
Together day by day
We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer
We know our dreams will all come true
With love that we can share
With you I never wonder will you be there for me?
With you I never wonder you're the right one for me?
I finally found the love of a lifetime
A love to last my whole life through
I finally found the love of a lifetime
Forever in my heart
...
We both sit silent still, at the end of the night
Although we both sit close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you,
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say,
'Every rose has it's thorn'
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy,
Sings a sad, sad song
Every rose has it's thorn
(Yeah it does)
...
Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
...
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So, I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
Doesn't mean they're always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long and winding road
...
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through
I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew that you were there for me
Time after time, you were there for me
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sand, I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you
...
1, 2, 3, 4
Hey (eh)
Forever
Hey (eh)
Forever
It's you, and me
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)
Tonight, is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music go 'round you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby We can go anywhere
Go anywhere
But first, it's your chance
Take my hand
Come with me
It's like I waited my whole life
For this one night
Its gon' be me you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun
And dance forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever (forever)
Ever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever on the dance floor
...
I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain, it's driving me crazy
We don't need to talk about it anymore
Yesterday's just a memory
Can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby
Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way
Can you take me high enough
To fly me over (fly me over) yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over, and yesterday's just a memory
...
I can't tell you, baby, what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago, I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all
That's left are the wounds I can't let go
If we take some time to think it over, baby
Take some time, let me know if you really wanna go
Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is
I did so wrong
Now I know what I got, it's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back, takes so long
I can't feel the things that cause you pain

Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm beggin' you (beggin' you)
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?

...
Kidz Bop, yeah man
So we back in the club
Get that bodies rocking from side to side, side, side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life, back, back to life
Hands up and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body, ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby tonight the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night of your life, life
...
Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel?
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blew from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Yeah, put under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite
The light and let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go
Oh, oh, oh
As you shoot across the sky
'Cause baby, you're a firework
...
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls
Perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad
To think that she don't see what I see
But every time
She asks me do I look okay? I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
...
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance (yeah)
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans (yeah)
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands (yeah)
Give me some space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on, and on, and on
And it goes on, and on, and on, yeah
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying, "Ayo, gotta let go"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying, "Ayo, baby, let's go"
'Cause we gon' rock this club, we gon' go all night
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
'Cause I told you once, now I told you twice
We gon' light it up like it's dynamite
...
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
You got your highbrow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't it
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise (shh)
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup, nobody knows who you even are
...
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
...
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Yea-yeah, yea-yeah, yea-yeah)
Let's get 'em
(Hey) I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that kids don't player
Stuntin' go wild can't handle this plan
Life of the club arrogant like yeah
Top like money so the floor just melt
Want to many all know me like Twelve
Looks so cool and they all just stare
Get up, stand up, dancin' on chairs
Fall out 'cause that's the business
All out it's so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out I'm in the building (hey)
They watchin' I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it
...
Been there done
Done that
Jumped around.
I'm having fun
Don't put me down.
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet.
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send.
My information is just not going in.
Burnin bridges shore to shore.
I break away from something more.
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap.
Been there.
Done that.
Jumped around.
I'm having fun
Don't put me down.
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet.
...
Empieza la emoción
Noble como un león
Hoy sentirás, recordarás
Que no hay limitación
En tu imaginación
Conviértela en realidad
En mi bandera llevo el alma
Amarrada por mi calma
Mi calma eres tú
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) Contigo me desencadeno
Ahora entra en mi terreno
Y ésta lucha te dedicaré
Llega el momento
(Oh oh) Donde eres el viento
(Oh oh) Hoy lucharé como un animal
(Oh oh) Como un animal, animal
(Oh oh) Escucha el aliento
(Oh oh) Solo silencio
(Oh oh) Hoy lucharé como un animal
(Oh oh) Como un animal, animal
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (hey)
Como un animal, animal
Cómo vas a vivir
Con miedo, compartir
...
Uhh, uhh, hey
I was thinkin 'bout her (uh)
Thinkin' 'bout me (hey)
Thinkin' 'bout us (us)
Where we gonna be? (hey)
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back (uhh)
Down that road (road)
Will she come back (us)?
No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement (hey)
Number 1 spot, now she find her replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
Now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My shawty, my wife
My shawty, my life
She left me, I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right
...
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track
It turns into gold
Everybody knows
I've got the magic in me
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
These tricks that I'll attempt
Will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse
I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer
How about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front
And stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time-travellin'
Have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill
So they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go
And take some classes
And I see Mindfreak like
What's up man, what's happenin'?
So come one, come all
And see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded
No Ghost or Poltergeist
...
You're at your job working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As you're lying on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a bunch of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
...
Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, safe tonight
I feel the sun creeping up like tick tock
I'm trying to keep you in my head but if not
We'll just keep running from tomorrow with our hearts locked
Yeah, you got me begging, begging
Baby, please don't go
If I find out tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gon' find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't
...
(Big mega radio smasher)
I had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
Oh I had the time of my life
And I've never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
You-you-you-you-you

I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'Til we can't do it no more
People rockin' to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in here
The temperature
Has got these ladies
Gettin' freakier
I got freaky, freaky, baby
I was chillin' with my ladies
I didn't come to get bougie
I came here to get crazy
I was born to get wild
That's my style
...
When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry
And yell at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that
She would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
But darling, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
...
Ohhhhh ohoooooo

...
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' on a juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna act a little crazy (at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
California girls, we're unforgettable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
Sun-kissed beach, so hot, will melt your Popsicle
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
...
Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I let you go and blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream, I dream
I knew when we collided,
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind
Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do, tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
...
When did we lose our way?
Easier to let it go
So many, can't tell anybody
Harder to let you know
Call me when you made up your mind
But you won't
Caught up in the way that you played my heart
Only love could ever hit this hard
Oh, don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel?
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
...
How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own, and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmm
It comes naturally
And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
When you're with me baby
Everything comes naturally
It comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
...
Hey, slow it down
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
Yeah, I'm afraid
What you want from me?
What you want from me?
There might have been a time when I would give myself away
Oh, once upon a time, I didn't give a thing
But now here we are
So, what you want from me?
What you want from me?
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
...
Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin but my time would be wasted
They got nothin on you, baby
Nothin on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
'Cause they got nothin on you, baby (Yeah...)
Nothin on you, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nothin on you)
I know you feel where I'm comin from (from)
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done (done)
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun (the uh)
On the carousel, so around I spun (spun)
With no directions, just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, livin in the summer sun (sun)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (Wha?)
And honestly, I ended up with none (Huh?)
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin, "Maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wonderin, if there was somethin that you wanna know
...
Whoa
Whoa
Now listen to me baby (oh, oh, oh)
Before I love and leave you (oh, oh, oh)
They call me heartbreaker (oh, oh, oh)
I don't wanna deceive you (oh, oh, oh)
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start
Baby, from the start
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart
...
All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They've got it better than when anyone's told you
They'll be the king of hearts and you're the queen of spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers
I know we got it good but they got it made
And the grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name
They've got all the right friends in all the right places
So, yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down
They say everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going
...
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey,
You know this could be somethin'
'Cause everything you do in words you say
You know it always takes my breath away
Now I'm left with nothin'
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
There's so much time,
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
...
Turn up the music
Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control
There's people watching me
I never miss a beat
Steal the night
Kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right
Keep it tight
'Cause it's pulling you in
Wrap it up
Can't stop 'cause it feels like a overdose
(Feels like an overdose)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
My body's aching
System overload
Temperature's rising
...
I wanna be a billionaire so very bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night
Oh, I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
I'll be playing basketball with the President, dunkin' on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the five and twenty's completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever is left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
...
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo 'round her finger, around you
You know that I love you, boy
Just like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your girl, I'm not your girl, Fernando
Don't wanna miss, don't want too much
Just walk away from me and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
She's not broken, she's just a baby
...
I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a thing that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't breakeven
Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a boy that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake, she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't breakeven
Even, no
What am I supposed to do
When the best part of me was always you? And
What am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up that you're okay?
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces
...
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, we just broke up
I'm doing my own little thing
You decided to dip and now you wanna trip
'Cause another boy, he noticed me
I'm into him, he's into me
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears for three good years
You can't be mad at me
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he's into it
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
...

Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
My body's aching
System overload
Temperature's rising
...
Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy (Hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door; I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Trying on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CD's
Rollin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm-a fight
'Til we see the sunlight
Tick-tock on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
...
I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh, my gosh
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get rocked
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov!
Look at her dancing, just dance along
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
Let's do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
'Cause I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
...
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, (woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab,
Here I am for the first time
Look to the right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummys turnin' and I'm feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on

...
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I see your dirty face hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray a lot to justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well, you made your bed, I'm in mine
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
...
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope ya feel the same
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus

Me and my band, man, on a yacht we relaxin'
Gettin' a tan, man
...
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you change your mind like a girl I would know
And you always think, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up
You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh
'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

It's gettin' late
I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate (yeah)
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're makin' stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't (don't go)
Do you know what you started? I just came here to party

We are the crowd, we're co-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true, need that picture of you
It's so magical, we'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means but this photo of us
It don't have a price, ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa, paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Papa, paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind, but I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
...
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
She'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You, you belong with me
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
...
Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louis Vuitton it up or Reeboking
You see the thing that they're serving on a platter
So what we gon' have, dessert or disaster?
I never thought I'd fall for you
As hard as I did
You got me thinking 'bout our life
Our house and kids
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy you came around
And you knocked me down
Knocked me down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up
When it knocks you down
Knocks you down
...
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
...
Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening
One minute it's love and suddenly
It's like a battlefield
One word turns in two, oh
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down?
My world's nothing when you don't
I'm not here without a shield, can't go back now
Both hands tied behind my back with nothing
(Oh, no)
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now?
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
A battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
A battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like?
Can't swallow our pride
Neither of us wanna raise that flag, hmm, hmm
If we can't surrender then
...
I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces
Fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
And all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers
Under cover of the street
...
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high, it
Never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on so I'm already gone
...
I'ma tell you one time
(Me plus you)
I'ma tell you one time
(Me plus you)
I'ma tell you one time
(One time)
One time
(One time)
When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop, stop
And even though it's a struggle, love is all we got
So we gon' keep, keep climbing to the mountaintop
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart
And now I've got my one love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time
(Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And I'ma be your one guy
You be my number one girl
Always making time for you
I'ma tell you one time
(Girl, I love, girl, I love you)
...
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't want to write a love song for the world
I just want to write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
...
Turn the lights on
Every night I rush to the bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I
Don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love's too good to be true
My guilty pleasure
I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're my
...
Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
Just hold a smile
Falling in and out of love
Ashamed and proud of
Together all the while
You can never say never
While we don't know when
Time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
...
Ooh
I can't go any further than this
Ooh
I miss you so badly, it's my biggest wish
Cool, I spend my time
Just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day
Yes, I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things
We used to, used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up?
It used to, used to be just me and you
I spend my time
Just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day
Yes, I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things
We used to, used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up?
What's up, what's up, what's up?
(Can you meet me halfway?)
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait
(For you)
(I'll be lookin' out)
Night 'n' day
(Took my heart to the limit)
(And this is where I'll stay)
...
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPod's stuck on replay, replay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like
Na, na, na, na, everyday
It's like my iPods' stuck on replay, replay
Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach you
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We are worldwide breakin' all the rules
She like a song played again and again
(That girl) like somethin' off a poster
(That girl) is the one, they say
(That girl) like somethin' off a poster
She's running through my mind all day
...
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain
Rain, rain
Rain on me
Rain, rain
Rain (mmm, oh yeah, baby)
Rain, rain
Rain on me
...
Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
...
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
...
Oh yeah I tell you somethin'
I think you'll understand
When I say that somethin'
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
Oh please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
Now, let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
...
It's been a hard day's night
And I'd been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money, to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
Because when I get you alone
You know I feel OK
...
The black eyed peas
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey, Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
...
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
He'd let us in, knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
...
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go go go, oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know, oh no
You say goodbye and I say hello
(Hello goodbye hello goodbye) Hello hello
(Hello goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello goodbye hello goodbye) Hello hello
(Hello goodbye) I don't know why you say goodbye

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
...
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
...
You say it's your birthday
It's my birthday too, yeah
They say it's you birthday
We're gonna have a good time
I'm glad it's your birthday
Happy birthday to you
Yes we're going to a party, party
Yes we're going to a party, party
...

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots (call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope ya feel the same
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody goin' trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
...
Fire burning, Kidz Bop

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
The letter you wrote me it still smells just like you
Ya, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you, aha
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you, aha
How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?, aha
All the things we thought about that never will happen again
I can just see you
If I had my way, I'd come and get ya, girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember around my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
...
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
...
I found him on the corner of 1st and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone saying that we never met
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything"
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of 1st and Amistad
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
...
We're driving slow through the snow on 5th Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
And we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside but between us it's worse in here
The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts
I can't take it any longer, thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger, slipping through my fingers
I don't wanna try now, all that's left's goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here, I hate this part right here
...
In the night I hear them talk coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul to a girl so heartless
How could you be so heartless? Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely
In the night I hear them talk coldest story ever told
...
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
...
Miya hee, miya ho
Miya hu, miya ha ha
Miya hee, miya ho
Miya hu, miya ha ha
You're gonna be a shinin' star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are
So live your life, hey
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life, oh
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, hey
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life, oh
'Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life, hey, my life, oh
My life, hey, my life, oh
Just livin' my life, hey, my life, oh
...
I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times have I kicked you out of here?
Or said something insulting?
(Da da da da-da)
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is
Broken
(Da da da da-da)
Please, don't leave me (da da da da-da)
Please, don't leave me (da da da da-da)
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me (da da da da-da)
How did I become so obnoxious?
...
My Eyes Are Open Wide
And By The Way, I Made It
Through The Day
I Watched The World Outside
By The Way, I'm Leaving Out
Today
Well, I Just Saw Hailey's
Comet Shooting
Said Why You Always Running
In Place?
Even The Man In The
Moon Disappears
Somewhere In The
Stratosphere
Tell My Mother,
Tell My Father
I've Done The Best I Can
To Make Them Realise
This Is My Life
I Hope They Understand
...
Am I supposed to put my life on hold because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going?
Am I supposed to be torn apart, broken-hearted in a corner cryin'?
Pardon me if I don't show it
I don't care if I never see you again
I know, know I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together
But either way baby I'm gone
I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wonderin'
I got that new I'm a single girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it, sing!
Na, na, na, na, hey
Na, na, na, na, hey
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye

Everybody come on off your seats
I'm gonna tell you about a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet
I'll give the barbecue show and tell you how to move
If you're 5 or 82 this is something you can do (whoa whoa)
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it, country fivin', hip hop hip
Put your hawks in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide
Zigzag 'cross the floor, shuffle in diagonal
When the drums hits hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist
And then a zigzag, step, slide
Lean in left, clap three times, shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
...
I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet

I guess I just lost my boyfriend
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna spend my money
I'm not gonna take his way
I got a brand-new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I'm gonna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I wanna start a fight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I wanna start a fight
So, so what, I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves and I don't need you
...
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
I see your dirty face hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray a lot to justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well, you made your bed, I'm in mine
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
...
Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around they scream your name
Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around they scream your name
Darkchild
Now I've got a confession (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Anything at all for them to notice me (La La La La)
But I ain't complaining (No)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what its like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see when I was younger I would say
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines
When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it- Get it?
They used to tell me I was silly (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Until I popped up on the T.V (La La La La)
I always wanted to be a superstar (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
...
Just another one champion sound
Me and you about to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see L.A.
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
I just met this 5 foot 7 boy who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
...
1, 2, 3, 4
Hey (eh)
Forever
Hey (eh)
Forever
It's you, and me
Movin' at the speed of light into eternity (yeah)
Tonight, is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music go 'round you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby We can go anywhere
Go anywhere
But first, it's your chance
Take my hand
Come with me
It's like I waited my whole life
For this one night

'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun
And dance forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever (forever)
Ever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever ever ever
Forever on the dance floor
...
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you change your mind like a girl I would know
And you always think, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes and you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
You're black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We hug, we make up
You, you don't really wanna stay, no
But you, you don't really wanna go, oh
'Cause you're hot and you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down
...
No more gas in the rig (can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (can't even speak about it)
On my life, on my head (don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
...
I'm hot, you're cold
You go around like you know
Who I am but you don't
You've got me on my toes, whoo
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin' under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
I fell (I fell) so fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself back (back, back)
High heels (High heels), red dress (red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath
I'm slippin' into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin' under
...
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool-done run out, I'll be giving it my best-est
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to
...
Da da da um da da
Da da da ba um da da
Da da da um da da
Da da da ba um da da
Hurry up and wait, so close but so far away
Everything that you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste but you just can't touch
You wanna show the world but no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face and the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient, waiting
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time, there's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly or falling in love
It's gonna happen and it's supposed to happen
When we find the reasons why one step at a time
...
Sha
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care, you know I care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you're here my dear
The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
...
It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to (whoa, oh)
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through (whoa, oh)
Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know (whoa, oh)
If you didn't notice (you mean everything)
Quickly I'm learning (to love again)
All I know is (I'ma be okay) (whoa, oh)
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (ooh, yeah)
It'll all get better in time
Even though I really love you
...
We were both young when I first you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please don't go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes
...
Crush
I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time
Deep inside it was a rush, what a rush, what a rush
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way
About me, it's just too much, just too much
Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know
Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
...
This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
...
Ohh, how 'bout a round of applause?
Yeah, standin' ovation
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry (please)
Just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin'
But now it's time to go
Curtains finally closin'
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
...
Tell me something, tell me, tell me
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in, there's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feeling
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreaming
I hear it everyday, I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, oh
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
How many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know
...
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
It's gettin' late
I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate (yeah)
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do
You're makin' stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I must say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't (don't go)
Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
And now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' crazy
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand, dancing fast
And now we're here to stay
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it
Please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music
I wanna take you away
Let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play
I just can't refuse it
Like the way you do this
...
Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder even I know that
You made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages, no easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving, I'm gonna need a better reason
To write you a love song today
...
You, you got me thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me, "Come and take a look inside"
You believed me in every single lie
But I, I failed you this time
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight, tonight
...
I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be
Tamed, never be tamed, never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I got a way of knowing when something is right, aha yeah
I feel like I must have known you in another life, another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I stu-stu-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breath, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being funny"
...
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me
You got me trippin' oh, stumblin' oh, flippin'oh, fumblin' oh
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin' oh, stumblin' oh, sinkin' oh, fumblin' oh
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
The girl can't help it, oh babe
She can't help it
...
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel
And every glance is hurting me
Time to make one last appeal
For the life I lead
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
...
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, frozen
But something happen for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking 'round thinking I'm going crazy, crazy
But I don't care what they say I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
...
I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes, 4 minutes, hey
I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes, 4 minutes, hey
I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes, 4 minutes, hey
I'm outta time and all I got is 4 minutes, 4 minutes, hey
Come on boy, I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll, pick up my stroll
Well, don't waste time, give me a sign
Tell me how you want to roll, how you want to roll
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow, there's enough room for both
Girl, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real
...
Whoa, whoa
Oh yeah
Whoa
Oh yeah
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true
When you look me in the eyes (look me in the eyes)
And tell me that you love me (tell me that you love me)
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes (look me in the eyes)
...
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh oh oh
Do what you want, but you're never gonna break me
Sticks and stones are never gonna shake me, oh, oh oh oh
I got a pocket, got a pocketful of sunshine
I got a love and I know that it's all mine, oh, oh oh oh
Wish that you could, but you ain't gonna own me
Do anything you want, you can't slow me down, oh no oh
Take me away (take me away), a secret place (a secret place)
A sweet escape (a sweet escape), take me away (take me away)
Take me away (take me away) to better days (to better days)
Take me away (take me away), a hiding place (a hiding place)
...
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (air, air)?
(Oooooh)
No air, air
No air, air
If I should fly before I wake
It's 'cause you took my breath away
Losing you is like living in a world with no air, oh
I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave
My heart won't move, it's incomplete
If there was a way that I can make you understand (understand)
But how (how) do you expect me (me) to live alone with just me (me)?
'Cause my world revolves around you
It's so hard for me to breathe
Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air (air)?
Can't live, can't breathe with no air (air)
It's how I feel whenever you ain't there (there)
There's no air, no air
Got me out here in the water so deep (deep)
Tell me how you gonna be without me (me)?
If you ain't here I just can't breathe
There's no air, no air (air)
...
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
...
Do, do you got a first aid kit handy?
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound?
Tell me, are, are, are, are you, are you patient, understanding?
'Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart and I
I've tried every remedy and nothing seems to work for me
Baby, this situations driving me crazy
And I really wanna be your girl
But the one before you left me so
Damaged, damaged
I thought that I should let you know
That my heart is damaged, damaged, so damaged
And you can blame the one before
So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(Baby, I gotta know)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(What you are gonna do, baby?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(Baby, I gotta know)
...
Ah ah
Ah ah
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing you, and now I'm sorry, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
...
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphone's
And they wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Tryna' catch his microphone check two, one, two
Wanna' believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do somethin' new?
Well ya' name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standin' outside of heaven
Waitin' for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a new comer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need holiday like lady who sung, "Blue"
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two ton's too
...
Not my time Not my time
Looking back at the beginning of this And how
Life was Just you and me and love and all of our friends Living life like an ocean But now the current's only pulling me down It?
S getting harder to breath, I can't breath It won?
T be too long and I will be going under Can you save me from this? 'Cause it?
S not my time, I'm not going There's a fear in me, it?
S not showing This could be the end of me And everything I know, ooh but I won?
T go, I won?
...

You've been around all night and that's a little long
You think you've got the right but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight so you can take me home, Mickey
'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey

Cut footloose

I been working so hard (so hard!)
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what? (For what?)
Oh, tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down (oh)
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off of my knees
Jack, get Mack
C'mon before we crack
...
Dessert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies, would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sale a contradiction?
You come and go, you come and go
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Didn't you hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
...
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy
Well, I talk about it, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about, talk about
Talk about movin'
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Won't you take me to

Jitterbug
Jitterbug
Jitterbug
You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high
When your loving starts
Jitterbug into my brain goes a' bang bang bang till my feet do the same
If something's bugging you
If something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleeping in my bed I was dreaming
But I should have been with you instead
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
Cause I'm not planning on going solo
...
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose and
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just
Don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
...
Aruba, Jamaica, oh I want to take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go, Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo
That's where you want to go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, oh I want to take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama

He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire

Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired, she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep (ah)
Brother's got a date to keep, he can't hang around
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our-
Our house, it has a crowd
There's always something happening, and it's usually quite loud
Our mom, she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down, and a mess is not allowed
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our-

I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have
That's all they really want is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck; it's tough
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay; for love
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
...
Was crying all night
I slept until noon
I just wanna lie in
My living room
I know in my heart
That your not the one
So I'll just stay home
Watch VH1
My girlfriends know what to do
They know what to say, Oh
My girlfriends to the rescue
Come take me away
I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna leave you behind
I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna loose my mind
With someone New New
With someone New New
With someone
...
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town
Down town the young ones are going
Down town the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America
We're the kids in America
Everybody live for the music-go-round
Bright ligths the music get faster
...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Totally dude
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rockstar, totally dude
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rockstar, totally dude
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rock, party like a rockstar
Party like a rockstar, totally dude
Party like a rockstar
Do it with the black and the white
Like a cop car, yeah
Me and my band, man, on a yacht we relaxin'
Gettin' a tan, man
...
You took my hand
You showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything, you said to me
Yeah, huh, that's right
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better
'Cause you said forever and ever
Who knew?
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh, no
No, no
I wish I could touch you again
...
The smell of the air lingers me now
You're probably on your flight back to your
Hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center, clarity, peace,
Serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses
Their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't
Cry
...
Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye, but we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right
Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free, tonight
Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
...
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me in denial, in denial
When you say it's over
Hey, all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do your dirt
They'll have you in denial, in denial
When they say it's over
See it started at the park
Used to chill into dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love lasts forever
Lasts forever
They say, we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together
Last together
See it's very define
You're one of a kind
But you mush up my mind
You walk to get declined
Oh Lord, my baby's drivin' me crazy
...
You never know how good you have it, oh-oh
Until you're starin' at a picture of the only girl that matters, ah-ah
I know what we're supposed to do
It's hard for me to let go of you
So I'm just tryna hold on
Hold on, I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone
I don't wanna move on
I don't wanna know what it's like when you're gone for good
You're slipping through my fingertipsa little bit, by a little bit
I didn't know that loving you was the happiest I've ever been
So I'm just tryna hold on
I need to learn how to cope without you
...
Hey there Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes, you do
Times square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me
Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
...
She's goin' out to forget they were together
All that time he was takin' her for granted
She wants to see if there's more
Than he gave, she's lookin' for
He calls her up, he's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's movin' it, knows she's usin' it
Now he's losin' it, she don't care
Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now if you got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now, you got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love
He was always givin' her attention
Lookin' hard to find the things she'd mention
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
...
I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make your sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late (it's too late, it's too late)
...
Now that it's all said and done
I can't believe you were the one
To build me up and tear me down
Like an old abandoned house
What you said when you left
Just left me cold and out of breath
Felt if I was in way too deep
Guess I let you get the best of me
Well, I never saw it coming
I should have started running
Long, long time ago
And I never thought I'd doubt you
I'm better off without you
More than you, more than you know
I'm slowly getting closure
I guess it's really over
I'm finally getting better
And now I'm picking up the pieces
Spending all of these years
Putting my heart back together
The day I thought I'd never get through
...
I never felt nothing in the world like this before (like this before)
Now I'm missing you and I'm wishing
You would come back through my door, ooh
Why did you have to go (go)? You could've let me know (know)
So now I'm all alone, ooh
Girl, you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance, no
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand, ooh
And all my tears they (they) keep running down my face (my face)
Why did you turn away?
So why does your pride make you run and hide
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lot what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be
So baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
...
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Why'd you have to go, ah, away from home, me love?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Why'd you have to go, ah, away from home, me love?
See the first time me lookin' at your eyes
Me be tell you want the guy like me
We use to have good time on the evenin'
Me an' you chillin' on the beach
We use hang out an' talk, an' trust me, girl
It feels so sweet
Then one day you move now, I'm feelin' kinda blue
'Cause we here you say you leave
I feel like I'm drownin' in the ocean
Somebody, come and take me away
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Why'd you have to go, ah, away from home, me love?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
...
We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken, it's easier to hide
Looking at you, holding my breath
For once in my life I'm scared to death
I'm taking a chance, letting you inside
Feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like being in love, she says for the first time
Maybe I'm wrong but I'm feeling right
Where I belong with you tonight
Like being in love to feel for the first time
...
I just want you close, so close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure, so sure
That it will only get better
You and me, you and me together
Through the days, through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Every thing's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Every thing's gonna be alright
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
...
Will you count me in?
I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place
It start in my toes, and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes I always know
That you make me smile, please, stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
The rain is pourin' on my window pane
But we are hidin' in a safer place
Under covers, stayin' dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
...
I told you I made dinner plans, aha
For you and me and no one else, no
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done with awkward situations (I'm done)
Empty conversations
Ooh, this is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true, I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walkin' on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get, oh
So this is where the story ends, aha
A conversation on IM (Well I'm done)
...
That's how much I love you, yeah
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Most everything you do makes me wanna smile
Can I not like it for a while?
No, but you don't let me, oh
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget that I was upset
I can't remember what we did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So then I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly what to say
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
...
Oh, oh, oh
No matter what you say about love, about love
I keep coming back for more, for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I'll get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life, about life
I learn every time I bleed, I bleed
That truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind, change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on
And leave you behind
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
...
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey!
You've been around all night and that's a little long
You think you've got the right but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight so you can take me home, Mickey
'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
...
Cut footloose
Cut footloose
Footloose
Footloose
I been working so hard (so hard!)
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what? (For what?)
Oh, tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just holding me down (oh)
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off of my knees
Jack, get Mack
C'mon before we crack
...
Dessert loving in your eyes all the way
If I listen to your lies, would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sale a contradiction?
You come and go, you come and go
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green
Didn't you hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
...
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy
Well, I talk about it, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it
Talk about, talk about
Talk about movin'
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Gotta move on
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown
Won't you take me to
Funkytown

Jitterbug
Jitterbug
Jitterbug
You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high
When your loving starts
Jitterbug into my brain goes a' bang bang bang till my feet do the same
If something's bugging you
If something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleeping in my bed I was dreaming
But I should have been with you instead
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
Cause I'm not planning on going solo
...
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose and
There ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just
Don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, we're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
Oh, you're so condescending
Your gall is never ending
We don't want nothin', not a thing from you
Your life is trite and jaded
...
Aruba, Jamaica, oh I want to take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go, Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo
That's where you want to go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, oh I want to take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go
Oh I want to take you down to
Kokomo, we'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
...
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
Yeah
Give me what I want
Yeah
I know someone who's tough but sweet
Oh so fine, he can't be beat
He's got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
...
Father wears his Sunday best
Mother's tired, she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister's sighing in her sleep (ah)
Brother's got a date to keep, he can't hang around
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our-
Our house, it has a crowd
There's always something happening, and it's usually quite loud
Our mom, she's so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down, and a mess is not allowed
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our-
...
I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have
That's all they really want is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck; it's tough
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay; for love
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Whoa, we're halfway there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
...
Was crying all night
I slept until noon
I just wanna lie in
My living room
I know in my heart
That your not the one
So I'll just stay home
Watch VH1
My girlfriends know what to do
They know what to say, Oh
My girlfriends to the rescue
Come take me away
I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna leave you behind
I'm on Vacation tonight
I'm gonna loose my mind
With someone New New
With someone New New
With someone
...
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town
Down town the young ones are going
Down town the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America
We're the kids in America
Everybody live for the music-go-round
Bright ligths the music get faster
...
Hey, hey, you you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you I want to be your girlfriend
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so
Delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so
Addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel
Alright?
Alright, alright, alright
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm precious
And so yeah, I'm like hey, hey princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right
I'm right, I'm right, I'm right
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everybody's talking about
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
...
Sweet escape, sweet escape
Yeah, bounce
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
If I could escape
I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting bad and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold
If I could escape (escape)
And recreate a place as my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever, we can make it better
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
Sweet escape, sweet escape
Woo hoo (yeah), yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo (I wanna get away)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
...
I was blown away, what could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything, and I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
Blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over
I've taken all I could take, and I can not wait
...
Hey, you don't mean nothin' to me
In the day, in the night, say it right, say it all
Either got it or you don't, you either stand or you fall
When your will is broken, when it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking, there's a hole in the plan
Oh, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
No, you don't mean nothin' at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
...
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So, why the love went away?
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't wanna think about it (uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (uh)
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby
'Cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah
Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
Maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you baby (baby)
And now, it's all just a shame
That I guess I was wrong
Don't wanna think about it (no)
Don't wanna talk about it (hum)
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
...
You had my heart and we'll never be world
Apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark you can't see shiny
Cars
And that's when you need me there with you'll
Always share
Because when the sun shines, we'll shine
Together
Told you'll be here forever
Said that I'll be your friend
Took an oath an' I'ma stick out till the end
Now it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, under my umbrella
Ella, ella. eh, eh, eh, under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
...
Are you ready?
If you ain't got no money take your broke self home
If you ain't got no money take your broke self home
G-L-A-M-O-are-O-you-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-are-O-you-S
We flyin' first class up in the sky
We flyin' first class, livin' the life
In the fast lane and I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh the flossy, flossy
Wear them gold and diamonds rings, all them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines, shoppin' for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and boogie scenes
...
From Underneath The Trees, We Watch The Sky
Confusing Stars For Satellites
I Never Dreamed That You'd Be Mine
But Here We Are, We're Here Tonight
Singing Amen, I'm Alive
Singing Amen, I'm Alive
If Everyone Cared And Nobody Cried
If Everyone Loved And Nobody Lied
If Everyone Shared And Swallowed Their Pride
We'd See The Day When Nobody Died
And I'm Singing
Amen I, I'm Alive
...
Ay
Ay
Nobody likes being played (ay)
Oh
Oh
He said (I'm)
Worth it (his)
Only try
I know things about him
That you wouldn't wanna read about
Kissed me
One and only
He's beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things
You just found out about
You'll never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
Have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
Ay, let's not kill the karma
...
Step one, you say, "We need to talk"
He walks, you say, "Sit down, it's just a talk"
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
...
Wake up with bloodshot eyes
Struggled to memorize
Way it felt to hearing lies
People that made you cry
Feel so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a thought about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
Can't stop my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
...
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you, babe
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you, babe
We gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight
Believe we gon' fight, fight for our right to love, yeah
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you
Nobody wanna see us together, nobody thought we'd last forever
I feel, I'm hopin' and prayin' things between us gon' get better
Boys steady comin' after you, the girls steady comin' after me
Seems like e'rybody wanna go for self and don't wanna respect boundary
Tellin' you all those lies, just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets I held inside
But just know that I tried to always apologize
I'ma have you first always in my heart to keep you by my side
Nobody wanna see us together, but it don't matter, no
'Cause I got you, babe
...
In the light of the sun
Is there anyone?
Oh, it has begun
Oh, dear, you look so lost
Your eyes are red when tears are shed
The world you must have crossed, you said
You don't know me, you don't even care
Oh yeah, you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah
Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
Across an open field
When flowers gaze at you
They're not the only ones
...
I don't mind you telling me what's been on your mind lately
I don't mind you speaking up
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush
Just slow me down, slow me down
Tell me tomorrow everything will be around
Just slow me down, slow me down
You're the one who keeps me on the ground
Baby, you can be tough, say enough is enough
You can even be blunt just do it with love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong, that I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'd be crushed just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love
...
Fussing and fighting, we back at it again
I know that, it's my fault, but you don't understand (no)
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma', good with pa', cool with all my niggas
I should try, truth is I wanna let you in, but no
Damn these memories, and it's crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Girl, I really wanna work this out, 'cause I'm tired of fighting
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm trying
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this, icebox where my heart used to be
But I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (no)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
But I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this icebox where my heart used to be (no)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (no)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Why can't I get it right, just can't let it go
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more
...
I'm staring out into the night
Tryna hide the pain
Going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel is a different kind of pain
I'm going home
Back to the place where I belong
Where love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
These places and these faces are getting old
So I'm going home
Miles are getting longer it seems
...
You've got your mother and your brother
Every other, undercover, telling you what to say
(Say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's Cupid
Baby, loving you has made me this way
(Way)
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know the situation's getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, just walk away
Just walk away, just walk away
...
If I wrote you a symphony
Would you say how much you mean to me?
(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you page me on the regular?
(Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
(Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Say, "I do")
Because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting in the grass, laying side by side
You can be my baby, gonna make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another girl that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away)
My love
...
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Probably
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
...
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears and
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
...
Come with me, hang the night
Just the say the words but boy it don't feel right
What do you expect me to say?
(You know it's just a little too late)
Take my hand and you say you've changed
But boy you know you're beggin' don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game
(You know it's just a little too late)
So let me go now
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on, I'm gonna say this now
Chance has come and gone
And you know, it's just a little too late
A little too long and I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
You know it's just a little too late
You say, you dream of my face
But you don't like me, you just like the chase
To be real, it doesn't matter anyway
You know it's just a little too late
...
This Time, This Place
Misused, Mistakes
Too Long, Too Late
Who Was I To Make You Wait
Just One Chance
Just One Breath
Just In Case There's Just One Left
'Cause You Know,
You Know, You Know
That I Love You
I Have Loved You All Along
And I Miss You
Been Far Away For Far Too Long
I Keep Dreaming You'll Be With Me
...
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
Woo hoo, woo hoo
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Woo hoo, woo hoo
I felt a little fear upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking
Woo hoo, woo hoo
When the big black horse said looked this way
Said, "Hey lady, will you marry me?"
Woo hoo, woo hoo
But I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no"
...
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
...
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away
I just can't keep hanging on, to you and me
I just don't know what is wrong, with you and me
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain, no
...
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in a box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
If I bought it, please don't touch
Keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on that Jag
Go move your bags, let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Telling me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a boy like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
...
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm OK
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
...
There go the street lights - the night's officially on,
I got the green light - to do what ever we want,
Gonna stand - outside - the box - and put the rules on hold,
Tonight
Carte blanche, first class for the evening
Ready, set, go
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night, that's right 'cause the party don't stop)
All the cameras come out for a public affair
(Who cares, let's rock, 'cause the party don't stop)
Hey Baby, I see you looking over here baby
Are you gonna keep looking - or get up?
And talk to me
Here's an opportunity that you don't wanna miss tonight
...got plans first class for the evening
Ready. Set. Go.
All the girls stepping out for a public affair
(All night (all night),
...
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting
(Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
(Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
(Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
...
Baby come back
Every day I try to play another game
But I can't take it, I try to fnd another boy
But all the while I can't face it
(Baby come back)
Why do I miss you so much? (miss you)
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby, please give us one more try
(Baby come back)
I see you with your friends
Laughin' it up as you pretend
To have a good time
I know 'cause I'm living the same lie
So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So I'll be the one
Yeah I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it, I'll say it again
(Baby come back)
Baby come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be
...
Your subtleties they strangle me
I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants, and all the needs
All I don't want to need at all
The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone
A weight is lifted on this evening
I give the final blow
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight, it ends tonight
A falling star, at least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
You're finding things that you didn't know
...
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls, Double-Dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
...
Honey, why you calling me so late?
It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything OK?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words; it makes me weak
And I never want to say goodbye
But girl, you make it hard to be faithful
...
Into your hand, into your mind
Out of your soul, race through your veins
You can't escape, you can't escape
Into your life, into your dreams
Out of the dark into the light
You can't explain, you can't explain
Can you feel it (Can you feel it)? Can you feel it? (Can you feel it)
Rushin' through your hair and rushin' through your head
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try
...
And let it rain, and clear it out
And let it rain, and clear it out
And let it rain, and clear it out
And let it rain, and clear it out
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
And let it rain, and clear it out
And let it rain, and clear it out
Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup, chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
...
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood, and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
...
The body's a temple, that's what we're told
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet
'Cause I've been living in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I've been living in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow
My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
...
I spent many years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a, a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I've been there, I've done that
But I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
...
She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go
And she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year, she had a lot on her mind
And she didn't pay attention, she was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air
...
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm OK
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
...
You're Not Sure That You Love Me
But You're Not Sure Enough To Let Me Go.
Baby It Aint Fair Ya Know
To Just Keep Me Hangin' Round,
You Say You Don't Wanna Hurt Me,
You Don't Wanna See My Tears.
So Why Are You Still Standin' Here
Just Watchin' Me Drown?
...
Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and kiss and that's too bad
She said, "I can go to work until you find another job"
I thought I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hardworking dad to being Mr. Mom
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the 15th time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom
Football, soccer and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left
...
She was in the back yard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin'
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
Sorry but I got to go
And that was all she wrote
Her Mama's heart was broke
And that was all she wrote
And so the story goes
Now her Daddy's in the kitchen
Starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
How can eighteen years just up and walk away
Our little pony tailed girl
Growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
...
I told you I made dinner plans, aha
For you and me and no one else, no
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done with awkward situations (I'm done)
Empty conversations
Ooh, this is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true, I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walkin' on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get, oh
So this is where the story ends, aha
A conversation on IM (Well I'm done)
...
Where is the moment when we need it the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue sky's faded to grey
Tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carrying on
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
...
Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall everyone sins
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
(Speak to me)
When all you gotta keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
...
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I, I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I'll never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way and it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because a moments weakness in your eyes
...
Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And oh I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me
Sing it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
...
I am unwritten, can't read my mind, I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand, ending unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with eyes wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Oh, oh, oh
I break tradition, sometimes my tries, are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes, but I can't live that way
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
...
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you
Need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you
Need to be with you, hey
Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't deal nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that
Now top to bottom, they see that we did that
Yes, it's so true that, yes, we've been through it
Yes, we got real, yeah, yes
See baby we've been too strong for too long
And I can't be without you baby
And I'll be waiting up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you baby
Anybody who's ever loved, you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby
I got a question for ya, see I already know the answer
Still I wanna ask you, would you lie? No
...
I'm talkin' bout love
All my girls stand in a circle and clap your hands this is for you
Ups and downs highs and lows no matter what you see me through
My boyfriend he don't answer on the telephone
I don't even know where the hell he goes
But all my girls we're in a circle and nobody's gonna break through
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
Oh did you hear me say?
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
Did you hear me say
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
I'm talkin' bout
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
I'm talkin' bout love, say you'll be my girls for life girls for like
Oh hold off I need another one
I think you, you do too
Grab my bag, got my own money
Don't need any man in this room
My boyfriend he'll be calling me now anytime
...
My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on a subway, she was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that 'cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
...
And pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Turn up the radio
Blast your stereo, right
Who? Where?
Why? What?
Come on, come on
Contagious, outrageous
Turn me up, turn it up
Turn me up, turn it up
Turn me up
Come on baby just
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
Pump it louder
And say, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yo yo, turn up the radio
Blast your stereo right now
This joint is sizzling
It's sizzling, right
...
Alright, alright
Alright
Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will, for you I will
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
'Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed
...
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
...
Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes, yeah
'Cause I want you and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
...
Small town homecoming queen
She's the star in this scene
There's no way to deny she's lovely
Perfect skin, perfect hair
Perfumed hearts everywhere
Tell myself that inside she's ugly
Maybe I'm just jealous
I can't help but hate her
Secretly I wonder if my boyfriend wants to date her
She is the prom queen I'm in the marching band
She is a cheerleader I'm sitting in the stands
She gets the top bunk I'm sleeping on the floor
...

When It's For Real, It's Forever
So Don't Forget About Us

I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good, hey
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no no no
...
Sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
Honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling too
(I just can't believe it's true)
Ah sugar, ah honey honey
...
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh
Be happy
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't worry, be happy

See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watchin' all their feet
They don't know where they're want to go
But their walking in time
They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat
See the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line
...
I'm sleeping and right in the middle of a good dream
And all at once I wake up from
Something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)
This morning (morning), I woke up with this feeling (feeling)
I didn't know how to deal with (deal with) and so I just decided to myself (huh)
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room
I think I love you (I think I love you)
I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
...
Forget you and your mom and your sister and your job
And that broke-down car and the things you call art
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all get lost
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start, hmm
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I know for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affеction
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna bе nice
...
All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know
If they move too quick (oh way oh)
They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh way oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Way oh way oh, way oh way oh
Walk like an Egyptian
The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh way oh)
...
Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world (and the world) will be a better place
And the world (and the world) will be a better place
For you (for you) and me (and me)
You just wait (just wait) and see
Another day goes by
And still the children cry
...
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
The more I gave the less I got, oh yeah
What's the use in tryin'
...
Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on
Please, swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
...
Hey, yeah
Woo!
Hey, yeah
Sing it to me, sing it to me
Hey, yeah
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing
Everyone can see we're together (together)
As we walk on by (fly)
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie (all)
...
I come home in the morning light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right"
Oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have fun
The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just want to have
That's all they really want is some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, girls, they wanna have fun
Oh, girls just wanna have fun
...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Seems like just yesterday
You were apart of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be strong
Your arms around me tight
Every thing it felt so right
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong
Now i can't breathe
No i can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here i am
Once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it
Can't pretend
Just thought of you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears i cry
Behind these hazel eyes
...
Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile isn't all that great
My fashion sense is a little whack
Got nothing in my pocket
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they, I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket
Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be (gimme gimme) (gimme gimme)
Living in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rolling like a celebrity (gimme gimme) (gimme gimme)
Living in Beverly Hills
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
...
Yeah
Uh, huh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you have to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fucking with your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor, and the author
I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me, I did to you
No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Cause no, no, no, no yeah
Know, know, know, know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I see you and what you're all about
...
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like the time has come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
...
I know there's something in the wake of your smile.
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea.
You've built a love but that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.
Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye.
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile.
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems,
The feeling of belonging to your dreams.
...
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
...

I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Yeah, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' cool like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on yeah
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
You know I'm feeling so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
...
Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket
Of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer
'Til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
...
These words are my own
Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you
Try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
(But it's not coming easily)
Woah oh!
Trying to find the magic (Woah oh)
Trying to write a classic (Woah oh)
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Woah oh)
Waste-bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later
These words are my own
From my heart flow
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
There's no other way
To better say
...
What Day Is It? And In What Month?
This Clock Never Seemed So Alive
I Can't Keep Up And I Can't Back Down
I've Been Losing So Much Time
Cause It's You And Me And All Of The People With Nothing To Do
Nothing To Lose
And It's You And Me And All Of The People
And I Don't Know Why, I Can't Keep My Eyes Off Of You
All Of The Things That I Want To Say Just Aren't Coming Out Right
I'm Tripping On Words
...
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
Sheb, sha-sha, feel good
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got a kissing
'Cause I don't get sleep, no
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
...
Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise look what's over me
Oh chariot your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
There is a living promised land
...
If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag, swag, swag, on you
Chilling by the fire why we eating fondue
I dunno about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two swag
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, lemme talk to you
If I was your boyfriend
Never let you go
Keep you on my arm, girl
You'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman
Anything you want
If I was your boyfriend
Never let you go, never let you go
...
How long before I get in
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide
Before I know what it feels like
Where to? Where do I go
If you've never tried then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I'll stop before I can stop
...
Sweet love yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here
'Cause baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
...
There's people talking
They talk about me
They know my name
They think they know everything
But they don't know anything
About me
Give me a dance floor
Give me a DJ
Play me a record
Forget what they say
'Cause I need to go
Need to get away tonight
I put my makeup
On a Saturday night
I try to make it happen
Try to make it all right
I know I make mistakes
I'm living life day to day
It's never really easy
But it's ok
Wake up! Wake up!
On a Saturday night
Could be New York
Maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris
Maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go tonight
Tonight, yeah tonight
...

I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good, hey
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no no no
...
Sugar, ah honey honey
You are my candy girl
And you got me wanting you
Honey, ah sugar sugar
You are my candy girl
And you've got me wanting you
I just can't believe the loveliness of loving you
(I just can't believe it's true)
I just can't believe the wonder of this feeling too
(I just can't believe it's true)
Ah sugar, ah honey honey
...
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double

It's Christmas
Baby, please come home
Yeah
(Christmas) the snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) watch the people around
(Christmas) baby, please come home
(Christmas) the church bells in town
(Christmas) they're ringing a song
(Christmas) what a happy sound
(Christmas) baby, please come home
They're singing Deck the Halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
...
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
...
Joy to the world
Joy to the world
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing
Joy to the world
Joy to the world
Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ

O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree
How lovely are thy branches

How lovely are thy branches
Your boughs so green in summertime
Stay bravely green in wintertime
O tannenbaum, o Christmas tree
How lovely are thy branches
...
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Christmas carol
Fa la la la la, la la la la
See the blazing Yule before us

Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la, la la la la

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land
...
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
...
Bah Humbug; now that's too strong!
'Cause it is my favorite holiday.
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season.
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year.
Ski shop encounter most interesting.
Had his number but never the time,
Most of '81 passed along those lines.
So deck those halls. Trim those trees.
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer.
I just need to catch my breath;
Christmas by myself this year
Calendar picture. Frozen landscape,
Chill this room for twenty-four days.
Evergreens. Sparkling snow.
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch.
Couldn't agree when we were both free.
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch.
Didn't of course 'till summer time,
Out to the beach to his boat.
Could I join him?
No. This time it was me;
Sunburn in the third degree.
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited.
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it.
...
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe
She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog,
And we'd begged her not to go.
But she'd left her medication,
So she stumbled out the door into the snow
When they found her Christmas mornin,'
At the scene of the attack.
There were hoof prints on her forehead,
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back
Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
...
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
(Merry Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
...
Welcome Christmas come this way
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas, Christmas day
Welcome, welcome fahoo ramus
Welcome, welcome dahoo damus
Christmas day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp
Fahoo fores dahoo dores
Welcome Christmas bring your cheer
...
Yeah
On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree
On the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings, four calling birds
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
On the sixth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Six geese a-laying
...
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
With cold kiss from Santa
You'll tie tigger
With Dancer and Prancer
Go, go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the mistletoe
Til we drop!
Dancin' all night
Lets go baby go go go.
Here's my favorite holiday,
My favorite time of year.
With cards we write,
A Christmas lights all wrapped
With Christmas cheer.
Gifts we give are memories
Will make it fall someday
We wish we had our history
When troubles go away
You gotta go go Christmas,
Don't stop the Jingle Bell,
Rocken 'round the
Mistletoe til we drop!
Angels in the snow
...
Here's the thing we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah yeah
Since U Been Gone
You dedicated you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah Yeah
Since U Been Gone
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I pictured me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say
But Since U Been Gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on
Yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
What I want
Since U Been Gone
...
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a...
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
...
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm the kinda brother
Who's been doin' it my way gettin' my bread for years
In my career
And every other
In and out my life, I hid love and left her tear
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
And I can't figure it out why I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I don't know what it is
But it seems she got me twisted
I'm so
Caught up
Got me feelin' it
Caught up
I'm loosin' control
This girl's got a hold on me
Oh, no
Let me go baby
Now listen
My momma told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
...
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
If I was a rich girl (na, na)
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
Cause I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first-class to my fancy house in London town
All the riches baby, won't mean anything
All the riches baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know
If I was rich girl (na, na)
See, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl
...
Mmmm... yeah... mm... yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm... yeah... uh... mm... yeah, yeah
Listen
Baby I just don't get it (get it)
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories (stories)
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are), whoo
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Baby girl, good love and protection
Make me your selection
I'll show you
...
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
Turn it up loud, captain.
Lights go down it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling so much
Stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide and though
Your soul it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
Hello hello
(Hola)
I'm at a place called Vertigo
(Dónde estás?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel, feel
...
Ladies and gentlemen (Ladies and gentlemen, ooh-wee)
This is a Jazze Phizzle Productshizzle (Jazze Phizzle)
Missy (Missy)
The princess is here (Ooh-wee)
(She's here) Ciara
(This beat is)
Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
Work my body, so melodic
This beat flows right through my chest
Everybody, Ma and Papi came to party
Grab somebody, work your body, work your body
Let me see you one, two step (Here we go)
Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up
We about to get it on
Let me see ya
One, two step
I love it when ya
One, two step
Everybody
One, two step
We about to get it on (This beat is)
Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
(Jazze made it)
So retarded, top-charted
Ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff and yes I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No, I can't control myself
...
Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
Words are only words
Can you show me something else
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
Just another heartache on my list
I don't wanna be angry no more
You're the one who could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me no for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
...
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
I replay it
Over and over again (yeah)
And I can't take it
Yeah, I can't shake it, no
I can't wait to see you
Want to see if you still got that
Look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same thing
Over and over again
Oh but I think she's leaving on (oh boy)
And she's leaving here, yeah
And I don't know what else to do
(Can't go on not loving you)
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it
Over and over again
And I can't keep
Picturing you with him
And it hurts so bad
Yeah, cause it's all in my head
...
Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs
She wants to go home
But nobody's home
That's where she lies
Broken inside
With no place to go
No place to go
To dry her eyes
Broken inside
...
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me I can find no rest
Where I'm going is anybody's guess
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is, incomplete
Voices tell me I should carry on
...
Knock, knock, knock, oh
Knock, knock, knock, oh
Knock, knock, knock, oh
Knock, knock, knock
Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
Hear voices I don't want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
...
I won't talk
I won't breathe
I won't move till you finally see
That you belong with me
You might think I don't look
But deep inside the corner of my mind
I'm attatched to you
I'm weak, it's true
'Cause I'm afraid to know the answer
Do you want me too?
Cause my heart keeps falling faster
I've waited all my life to cross this line
To the only thing that's true
...
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last and
Good on paper, picture perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
Ooh, and I wished you had hurt me harder than I hurt you
Ooh, and I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hoping
Someone will love you, let me go
Someone will love you, let me go
...
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore.
And how you need you're space and give the keys back to your door.
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me.
And still you said your love was gone and that I had to leave.
Now your talkin' 'bout a family.
Now your sayin' you complete my dreams.
Oh
Now your sayin' I'm your everything
Your confusing me
What you sayin' me don't play with me' don't play with me cause
What goes around comes around,
What goes up must come down
Now who's cryin desiring to come back to me
What goes around comes around,
What goes up must come down.
Now who's cryin desiring to come back to me
I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waitin for you till 3 o'clock in the 'morn
...
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot then we can die
I know I won't be leaving here with you
I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "You don't show"
Don't move time is slow
I say, "Take me out"
Well I say, "You don't know"
You say, "You don't go"
...
On a Monday, I am waiting
Tuesday, I am fading
And by Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings, I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause' you've come to rescue me
Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts
It seems like I can finally rest
My head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better than
I ever knew myself, I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
...
Let's get it started in here
And the bass keeps runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and runnin', runnin'
And runnin', runnin' and
In this context there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got 5 minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out, girl it's gonna be that
You wouldn't believe how we wow this out
Burn it till it's burned out, turn it till it's turned out
Actin' up from north, west, east, south
Everybody, yeah, everybody, yeah
Let's get into it, yeah, get stupid, come on
Get it started, come on, get it started, yeah
Get it started
Let's get it started, ha
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha
Let's get it started in here
Let's get it started, ha
Let's get it started in here
Lose control of body and soul
Don't move too fast, people, just take it slow
...
Da da da da, da da da da, da da da da, da da da
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
Trying hard to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray
I could breakaway
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes? til I touch the sky (yeah)
(And I'll make a wish) And I'll make a wish,
(Take a chance) take a chance, make a change
...
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread
You were all the things
I thought I knew
And I thought we could be
You were everything
Everything that I wanted
We were meant to be
Supposed to be, but we lost it
And all the memories
So close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
You've got your dumb friends
...
Ummm oh ohhh... yeah...
I've been waiting all day for ya babe
So won't you come and sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together always?
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever
(I never thought that anyone)
Could make me feel this way
(Now that you're here boy all I want)
Is just a chance to say
Get out, (leave) right now,
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)
Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold
To go behind my back and call my friend?
...
Sick and Tired of this world
There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere
Waiting
Suffocating
No direction
And I took a dive
And on the way down
I saw you
And you saved me
From myself
And I won't forget
The way you loved me
On the way down
I almost fell right through
But I held onto you
I've been wondering why
It's only me
Have you always been inside
Waiting to breathe
It's alright
...
Beauty queen of only eighteen, she had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her, she always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles, and wound up at your door
I've had you so many times, but somehow I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure, it doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies,
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
...
Hit me!!!
Can you keep up baby boy?
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard
Make me lose my ah ah
Can you keep up baby boy?
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard
Make me lose my breath
Ooh
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I done done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast, baby now I can't find you
Ooh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like you can't come through
All them lines like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel but you can't drive me
Can you keep up baby boy?
Make me lose my breath
Bring the noise
Make me lose my breath
Hit me hard
...
So she said what's the problem baby,
What's the problem I don't know,
Well maybe I'm in love,
Think about it every time,
I think about it,
Can't stop thinking about it.
How much longer will it take to cure this,
Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love,
Makes me wanna turn around and face me,
But I don't know nothing 'bout love.
Come on, come on, turn a little faster,
Come on, come on, the world will follow after,
Come on, come on, because everybody's after love.
So I said I'm a snowball running,
Running down into the spring that's coming,
All this love melting under blue skies,
Belting out sunlight, shimmering love.
Well baby I surrender,
To the strawberry ice cream,
Never ever end of all this love,
...
Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
...
Welcome to the planet
Welcome to existence
Everyone's here
Everyone's here
Everybody's watching you now
Everybody waits for you now
What happens next?
What happens next?
I dare you to move
I dare you to move
I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor
I dare you to move
I dare you to move
Like today never happened
Today never happened before
...
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
...
Debbie just hit the wall,
She never had it all.
One Prozac a day,
Husband's a CPA.
Her dreams went out the door
When she turned 24.
Only been with one man.
What happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress,
She was gonna be a star.
She was gonna shake it fast,
On the hood of White Snake's car.
Her yellow SUV,
Is now the enemy.
Looks at her average life,
And nothin'-has been-all right.
Springsteen, Madonna,
Way before Nirvana.
There was U2, and Blondie,
And music still on MTV.
Her two kids, in high school,
They tell her that she's uncool.
'Cause she's still preoccupied,
With 19, 19, 1985!
...
I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
...
I backed my car into a cop car the other day, yeah
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say? Yeah
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well
A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight-of-hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands, yeah
...
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
I know that you are something special
To you I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
...
Do You Ever Feel Like Breaking Down?
Do You Ever Feel Out Of Place?
Like Somehow You Just Don't Belong
And No One Understands You
Do You Ever Wanna Runaway?
Do You Lock Yourself In Your Room?
With The Radio On Turned Up So Loud
That No One Hears You Screaming
No You Don't Know What It's Like
When Nothing Feels All Right
You Don't Know What It's Like
To Be Like Me
To Be Hurt
To Feel Lost
To Be Left Out In The Dark
To Be Kicked When You're Down
To Feel Like You've Been Pushed Around
To Be On The Edge Of Breaking Down
With No One's There To Save You
...
There's always that one person that will always have your heart
You'll never see it comin', 'cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
Ooh baby, oh
(You gotta rock away to this one)
You will always be my boo
See, I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
Do you remember girl, I was the one who gave you your first kiss?
'Cause I remember girl I was the one who said put your lips like this
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there and you were my baby
It started when we were younger you were mine, my boo
Now another brother's taken over but it's still in your eyes, my boo
Even though we use to argue it's alright, my boo
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
...
I need you boo and I see you boo
And the heart's all over the world tonight
Said the heart's all over the world tonight
Hey, little mama, ooh you're a winner
Hey, little mama, yes you're a winner
I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class all your own world
Ooh, little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops
You're my sweetheart
I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and
You mean to me
What I mean to you and
Together baby
There is nothing we won't do
'Cause if I got you
I don't need money
I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all
And oh, I'm into you
Girl, no one else would do
'Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love
And now I know I can't be the only one
I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life who feel
What I feel when I'm
...
Let's go back (go back), back to the beginning (back to the beginning)
Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned (aligned)
'Cause perfect (perfect), didn't feel so perfect (didn't feel so perfect)
Trying to fit a square inot a circle was no life, I defy (I defy)
Let the rain fall down and wake my dreams
Let it wash away, my sanity
'Cause I wanna feel the thunder, I wanna scream
Let the rain fall down, I'm coming clean, I'm coming clean
Ohh oh, ah ah
I'm shedding (shedding), shedding every color (shedding every color)
Trying to find a pigment of truth beneath my skin (beneath my skin), oh
'Cause different (different), didn't feel so different (didn't feel so different)
And going out is better, than always staying in (always staying in), feel the wind)
...
So one, two, three, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine.
I say you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine.
Oh, four, five, six c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya honey.
Big black boots,
Long blonde hair,
She's so sweet
With her get back stare.
Well I could see,
You home with me,
But you were with another man, yeah!
I know we,
...
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I'm sorry that I hurt you
...
Baby, can't you see?
I'm calling a guy like you
Should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape
I can't wait, I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning â€ round and â€ round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
Taste of the poison paradise, I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
...
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time can not erase
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
...
All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on because I realized I've got
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong
...
This world, this world is cold
But you don't, you don't have to go
You're feeling sad, you're feeling lonely
And no one seems to care
Your mother's gone and your father hits you
This pain you cannot bear
But we all bleed the same way as you do
And we all have the same things to go through
Hold on, if you feel like letting go
Hold on, it gets better than you know
Your days, you say they're way too long
And your nights, you can't sleep at all
...
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's takin' almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby I'll try to love again but I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worse
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
...
There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both 16 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day, staying up all night
Staying up all night
There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both 18 and it felt so right
Sleeping all day, staying up all night
Staying up all night
If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
...
I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
...
Fumbling his confidence
And wondering why
The world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, to fly
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
...
Well in comes di ting dem call di broken heart

...
Don't look at me
Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain, feel so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
...
Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
...
You ready
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no
...
One, two, three!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
This I know fo sho!
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
Because the thought alone is killin' me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together
Like we don't know how
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it when there's nothin' at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
...
Now, Don't Just Walk Away
Pretending Everything's Okay And You Don't Care About Me.
And I Know It's Just No Use
When All Your Lies Become Your Truths And I Don't Care Yeah Yeah Yeah
Could You Look Me In The Eye
And Tell Me That You're Happy Now Oooooh
Would You Tell It To My Face Or Have I Been Erased
Are You Happy Now?
Are You Happy Now?
...
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible
I won't let you feel that now
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
...
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
My heart is like the open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
This is for the ones who stood their ground
It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down
...
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face.
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same.
All the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face.
I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind.
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time.
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
...
Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the nineties
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Avoiding all work
Because there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
...
So yesterday
So yesterday
So yesterday
You can change your life
(If you wanna)
You can change your clothes
(If you wanna)
If you change your mind
Well that's the way it goes
But I'm gonna keep your jeans
And your old black hat
('Cause I wanna)
They look good on me
You're never gonna get them back
At least not today
Not today, not today
'Cause if it's over let it go and
Come tomorrow it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
I'm just a bird that's already flown away
Laugh it off, let it go and
When you wake up it will seem
So yesterday, so yesterday
...
Since the moment i spotted you
Like walking round with little wings on my shoes
...
How the hell'd we wind up like this
And why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed?
And try to turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late
Nothing's wrong
Just as long as you know that someday I will
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
You're the only one who knows that
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright
But not right now
I know you're wondering when
Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
...
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But everyday is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me callin' for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Another sunrise
Her hand, it fit right in my hands, la la la
...
Uh oh, Uh ooo, uh oh, Uh ooo
Honestly
If I tell
Tell you what
What you want to know love
There ain't another
I don't want no other lover
I put nothin' above ya
I kick them to the gutter
They tryin' to shake me
Ya know ya lovin' me crazy
Look at us lately
And tell em whose your lady
I never thought you'd be the one
To make me shine brighter then the sun
There ain't no ups and downs
No in and outs
...
Circling Your Head Contemplating Everything You Ever Said
Now I Know The Truth I Got A Doubt
A Different Motive In Your Eyes And Now I'm Out
See You Later
I See Your Fantasy You Want To Make A Reality Paved In Gold
See Inside, Inside Of Our Heads
Well That's All Over We Heard What You Said
Back Off We'll Take You On
Headstrong To Take On Anyone
...
Everybody's talking
But they don't say a thing
They look at me with sad eyes, but I don't want the sympathy
It's cool you didn't want me
Sometimes you can't go back
But why'd you have to go and make a mess like that?
Well, I just have to say
Before I let go
Have you ever been low?
Have you ever had a friend that let you down so?
When the truth came out
Were you the last to know?
Were you left out in the cold?
'Cause what you did was low
No, I don't need your number
There's nothing left to say
Except I never thought it'd hurt this much to be saved
...
All the people in the crowd
Grab a partner, take it down
It's just me against the music, its just me and me, yeah come on
Hey Britney, are you ready, uh-huh, are you?
When no one cares
It's whipping my hair
It's pulling my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is dripping all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancing up in this place
Tonight I'm here
To the beat of the drum, gotta give it that bass
I want to get stupid
Trying to take my music
It's like a competition
Me against the beat
I want to get in the zone
I want to get in the zone
If you really want to party
Send my love and get ya
Really to hit, you could die
In a minute, I'ma take-a ya on, I'ma take-a ya on
(Hey hey hey)
All my people on the floor let me see you dance
All my people up for more let me see you dance
All my people, 'round and 'round let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
(Wont you let me got to show just take on the zone)
Let's take on the zone, lets take on the zone
(If you really want to battle)
...
I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just take it slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
...
I'd rather rescue myself
When I was just a little girl
My mama used to tuck me into bed
And she'd read me a story
It always was about a princess in distress
And how a guy would save her
And end up with the glory
I'd lie in bed
And think about
The person that I wanted to be
The one day I realized
The fairy tale life wasn't for me
All: I don't wanna be like Cinderella
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free (Come and set me free)
I don't wanna be like snow white waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
Oh I will survive
...
Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
...
Okay, talk to you
South America, Australia
France, Germany, UK, Africa
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City
All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging, swaying, records playing
Dancing in the street, oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
...
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
...
When all the tears are rolling down your face
And it feels like yours was the only heart to break
When you come back home and all the lights are out
And you're getting used to no one else being around
Oh, oh, I'll be there
When you need a little love, I got a little love to share
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna come through
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
Oh, I swear, I got enough love for two
You'll never be alone, I'll be there for you
When it's Friday night and the sun don't work the same
...
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life
Me and you and you and me
...
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobble stones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy
Ba da, da, da, da, da, da
Feelin' groovy
Hello lamp-post, whatcha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
...
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
...
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
...
I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Boy, you just don't realize
What you do to me
Your lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
You just keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine
When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's alright
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
...
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning,
Though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending,
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears
...
You, who are on the road must have a code that you can live by.
And so become yourself because the past is just a good bye.
Teach your children well, their father's hell did slowly go by,
And feed them on your dreams,
The one they fix, the one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you would cry,
...
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
Just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Oh, raindrops keep fallin' on my head
Keep a-fallin'
Cause I just done me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Oh, raindrops keep fallin' on my head
Keep a-fallin'
...
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darling, darling
Stand by me, oh stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
...
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
All of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy she said, "See you later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth, yeah
Five years from now she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV guess who she sees
Skater boy, rockin' up MTV
...
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
From In Living Color and movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this headline clips
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real, I thought I told you
I really been on Oprah
That's just me
Nothin' phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
...
Miss Independent, Miss Self-Sufficient
Miss Keep Your Distance, mmm
Miss Unafraid, Miss Out My Way
Miss, don't let a man interfere, no
Miss On Her Own, Miss Almost Grown
Miss, never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little Miss Apprehensive
Said ooo, she fell in love
What is this feeling taking over?
Thinking no one could open the door
Surprise it's time to feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye old you when love is true
...
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
(Wake me up)
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside
(Save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up)
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up)
Before I come undone
(Save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life
(Wake me up)
...
Everyday is so wonderful
Then suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful
In every single way
Yes words can't bring me down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed
In all your doom, ooh
...
Tell me
Just what you want me to be
One kiss
And boom you're the only one for me
So please tell me
Why don't you come around no more?
Cause right now
I'm crying outside the door of your candy store
It just takes a little bit of this, a little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain
I'm telling you my babe
It's all in the game of?
Love is
Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine
Instead of this cold lonely sea
...
There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're, you're something else
Do you really love it underneath it all?
Do you want to love me underneath it all?
I'm really lucky underneath it all
You're really lovely
You know some real bad tricks and you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard and giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep that I've ever had
And when it's really bad, I guess, it's not that bad
Do you really love it underneath it all?
Do you want to love me underneath it all?
...
There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away, maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone, love me when I'm gone
...
Let's go
Don't wantcha for the weekend
Don't wantcha for a night
I'm only interested
If I can have you for life, yeah
I know I sound serious
And baby, I am
You're a fine piece of real estate
And I'm gonna get me some land
Oh, yeah
So, don't try to run, honey
Love can be fun
There's no need to be alone
When you find that someone
I'm gonna getcha while I gotcha in sight
I'm gonna getcha if it takes all night
You can betcha by the time I say, "Go"
You'll never say, "No"
I'm gonna getcha, it's a matter of fact
I'm gonna getcha, don'tcha worry 'bout that
You can bet your bottom dollar
...
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say somethings are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
Should've picked honesty
...
I'm just a simple girl
In a high-tech digital world
I really try to understand
All the powers that rule this land
They say Ms. J's big butt is boss
Kate Moss can't find a job
In a world of post-modern fad
What was good now is bad
It's not hard to understand
Just follow this simple plan
Follow your heart, your intuition
It will lead you in the right direction
Let go of your mind, your intuition
It's easy to find, just follow your heart, baby
You look at me, but you're not quite sure
...
Oh yeah, this KIDZ BOP, we gonna kick it like this
We gon' keep you movin' on the dance floor
Move it, man
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
C'mon ladies, rock the party, shake your body, everybody
C'mon everybody, let's move it all night
Gonna take you back to the old school
Can you feel the vibe? (Feel the vibe)
Just dance to the rhythm
And let me see you wind your waistline
Jump back and the do the twist
And the electric slide, yeah, yeah (move it, man)
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
Can you move it like this? I can shake it like that
C'mon fellas, rock the party, shake your body, everybody
...
It's been five months since you went away
Left without a word
Nothin' to say (nothin' to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no, oh-oh
So I asked God
God send me an angel from the Heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (cry)
God send me an Angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
And I, know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something that I have to do
I have to tell the one, that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
...
Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there
And i'm here waiting
And i wrote this letter in my head
'Cuz so many thing were left unsaid
But now you're gone
And i can't think straight
This could be the one last chance
To make you understand
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow i can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
...
Mira lo que se avecina
A la vuelta de la esquina
Viene Diego rumbeando
Con la luna en las pupilas
Y su traje agua marina
Va después de contrabando
Y donde mas no cabe un alma
Y se mete a darse caña
Poseído por el ritmo ragatanga
Y el dj que lo conoce toca el himno de las doce
Para Diego la canción más deseada
Y la baila, y la goza, y la canta
Aserejé ja deje
Dejebe tu dejebe
Sebi unuova majabi
Ande bugui ande güididipi
Aserejé ja deje
Dejebe tu dejebe
Sebi unuova majabi
Ande bugui ande güididipi
Aserejé ja deje
Dejebe tu dejebe
Sebi unuova majabi
Ande bugui ande güididipi
No es cosa de brujería
Que lo encuentre to' los días
Por donde voy caminando
Diego tiene chulería y ese punto de alegría
Raftafari-afrogitano
Y donde mas no cabe un alma
Y se mete a darse caña
...
Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
...
My friend the communist
Holds meetings in his RV
I can't afford his gas
So I'm stuck here watching TV
I don't have digital
I don't have diddly squat
It's not having what you want
It's wanting what you've got
I'm gonna soak up the sun
Gonna tell everyone
To lighten up
(I'm gonna tell 'em that)
I've got no one to blame
For every time I feel lame
I'm looking up
(I'm gonna soak up the sun)
I'm gonna soak up the sun
I've got a crummy job
It don't pay near enough
(To buy the things it takes)
To win me some of your love
...
Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is
Chill out, what you yellin' for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talking to me one on one
But you've become...
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watching your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated
Life's like this
You, you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no
...
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrified
'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile, I, I loved you
You were my girl
You see I thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight
Aw girl, your face is sayin' why
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
Listenin' to friends, now it's the end
And again, no story can end without it
All right, I loved you
...
I Wanted To Be Like You
I Wanted Everything
So I Tried To Be Like You
And I Got Swept Away
I Didn't Know That It Was So Cold
And You Needed Someone
To Show You The Way
So I Took Your Hand And We Figured Out
That When The Tide Comes
I'd Take You Away
If You Want To
I Can Save You
I Can Take You Away From Here
So Lonely Inside
...
Every day is a new day
I'm thankful for every breath I take
I won't take it for granted (I won't take it for granted)
So I learn from my mistakes
It's beyond my control
Sometimes it's best to let go
Whatever happens in this lifetime
So I trust in love (so I trust in love)
You have given me peace of mind
I, I feel so alive
For the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I, I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
For the very first time (for the very first time)
And I think I can fly (fly fly fly)
Sunshine upon my face (sunshine upon my face)
A new song for me to sing
Show the world how I feel inside (show the world how I feel inside)
...
Never win first place, I don't support the team
I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me
I was always in a fight 'cause I can't do nothin' right
Every day I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person starin' back at me
I'm a hazard to myself
Don't let me get me, I'm my own worst enemy
It's bad when you annoy yourself, so irritating
Don't wanna be my friend no more
I wanna be somebody else
I wanna be somebody else, yeah-yeah
L.A. told me, "You'll be a pop star
...
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby I would climb the Andes soley
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody
Le do lo le lo le. le do lo le lo le
Can't you see... I'm at your feet
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
...
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to you say
Sunshine is you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like i don't care baby by the way
Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness means to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do
Here comes bad news talking this and that
Well, give me all you got and don't hold it back
I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
No offense to you don't waste your time, here's why
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is truth
Because I'm happy
...
So lately, I've been wonderin'
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall
It would fall upon us all
And between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
And maybe, I'll find out
The way to make it back someday
...
Hey, hey, you you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, you know it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you I want to be your girlfriend
You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so
Delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so
Addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel
Alright?
Alright, alright, alright
Don't pretend, I think you know I'm precious
And so yeah, I'm like hey, hey princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right
I'm right, I'm right, I'm right
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everybody's talking about
Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
...
Making my way downtown, walking fast
Faces pass and I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight
It's always times like these when I think of you
And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause every thing's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory
...
I Am So High, I Can Hear Heaven
I Am So High, I Can Hear Heaven
Whoa, But Heaven... No, Heaven Don't Hear Me
And They Say
That A Hero Could Save Us
I'm Not Gonna Stand Here And Wait
I'll Hold Onto The Wings Of The Eagles
Watch As We All Fly Away
Someone Told Me
Love Would All Save Us
But, How Can That Be
...
Well I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed up reasons for me to stay
Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
Well, I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling and there's no reason
Let's make the call and take it all again
Whoa, again
Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red
I took a chance and left you standing
...
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
We've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment
Like this
...
I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
...
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes-Benz
I got lots of style, got my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
I'm coming up so you better get this party started
...
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chilling
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on surviving (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on surviving (what?)
Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lasting
You thought that I would die without you, but I'm living
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm still gon' be here
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm not gon' give up (what?)
I'm not gon' stop (what?)
I'm gon' work harder (what?)
I'm a survivor (what?)
I'm gonna make it (what?)
I will survive (what?)
Keep on surviving (what?)
...
Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started
Chasing after you
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
I'm hanging by a moment here with you
Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation,
And you take all of me now
I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held on to
I'm standing here until you make me move
...
Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute
But I got something to tell ya, listen
See the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles, just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed but I was schooled
I'm reminded when I look at you
But you remind of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get it with you
Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her dream
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
...
Called you on the phone
Said I'm comin' through
Hope your all alone
'Cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home
Or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you
Doesn't matter what we do
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try understand
Baby there's no mystery
'Cause you know how I am
I'm real
What you get is what you see
What you tryin' to do to me
You want to say your mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
And you just can't get enough
You're tellin' all your friends
She's a bad, bad bitch
You like the way I dress
The way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends
And baby I don't care
Just as long as you
Tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one who made you give a damn
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do
Just know that I'm here with you
Don't try understand
Baby there's no mystery
...
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about
...
It's been a long time (long time), we shouldn't of left you (left you),
Without a dope beat to step to (step to, step to, step to, step to).
It's been a long time (long time), we shouldn't of left you (left you),
Without a dope beat to step to (step to, step to, step to, step to).
What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give it up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?
Tell all the boys, or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away,
Or play me off or would you stay?
Oh
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
...
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
The more I gave the less I got, oh yeah
What's the use in tryin'
...
I Am So High, I Can Hear Heaven
I Am So High, I Can Hear Heaven
Whoa, But Heaven... No, Heaven Don't Hear Me
And They Say
That A Hero Could Save Us
I'm Not Gonna Stand Here And Wait
I'll Hold Onto The Wings Of The Eagles
Watch As We All Fly Away
Someone Told Me
Love Would All Save Us
But, How Can That Be
...
Turn it inside out so I can see
The part of you that's driftin' over me
And when I wake you're, you never there
But when I sleep you're, you everywhere
You everywhere
Just tell me, how I got this far?
Just tell me, why you're here? And who you are?
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, ooh ooh ooh
I'm not alone
I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
...
Ooh, yeah
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what,
It's gonna be me
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind (too blind), to see
...
She rolls the window down
And she
Talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by
And I don't know why
But she's changed my mind
Would you look at her
She looks at me
She's got me thinking about her constantly
But she don't know how I feel
And as she carries on without a doubt
I wonder if she's figured out
I'm crazy for this girl
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl
She was the one to hold me
The night
The sky fell down
...
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby (yeah yeah yeah)
Come on over, come on over, baby
Hey, boy, don't you know I've got something going on
I got invitation, don't keep me waitin' all night long
I know you know, so baby don't pretend you won't keep me guessing if ya
You will you won't don't want to play a game with baby
So listen to me
All I want is you
(Come over here baby)
All I want is you
(You know make me go crazy)
All I want is you
(Now baby don't be shy)
(You better cross the line)
I'm gonna love you right 'cuz all I want is you
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby
Come on over, come on over, baby
I'm not just talkin' about your personality, yeah (your personality)
But I can't help myself when you put your arms around on
Is paradise when you and I
Get close, get tight
...
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you
Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin'
Makes me so confused
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I love you
...
Give it your all girl, give it all ya got.
Take your chance at a second hand shot.
Say what you want girl, Do what you do.
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you.
Pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way.
Keep pulling til'it says what you want to say.
Girl you can pick a field full of Daises but he'd still be my baby
I know you can hardly wait till I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking,
You'll be giving him an open invitation,
But my baby won't be taken it.
You can pout your cherry lips,
Try to tempt with a sweet kiss.
You can flutt your pretty eyes,
He ain't got his hands tied.
No chains to unlock,
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you,
...
Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
...
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!.You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
You see my problem is this
...
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye...
Bye, bye...
Oh, oh.
I'm doin' this tonight,
You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.
Hey, baby, come on.
I loved you endlessly,
When you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave
And make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...
Bye, bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me, but it ain't no lie,
Baby, bye, bye, bye...
Bye, bye
Don't really wanna make it tough,
I just wanna tell you that I had enough.
...
All the small things
True care, love brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating
Say it ain't so
I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na
...
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs, ooh
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together, while I figured it out, yeah yeah
I only looked, but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for bein' there for me
Ooh
What I want is whatcha got
Oooh yeah
And whatcha got is what I want
There was a time I was blind
...
Yeah
You are my fire
The one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way
But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way
Am I your fire?
Your one desire?
...
Clap your hands, all so right
(Turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, all so right
Clap your hands, all so right
Clap your hands, all so right
If tomorrow is judgment day
(Sing Mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line
And the lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
If I wake up in World War III
(World war, in world war III)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
(Clap your hands, all so right)
'Cause your love is my love
(My love)
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
...
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius
You drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case
...
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Come on!
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Come on!
Livin' la vida loca
...
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't breakthrough
There's no talking to you
So sad that you're leaving
Takes time to believe in
But after all, is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one
Oh, do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
What am I supposed to do
...
I was lying on the grass on Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self defeat
My mind was thugged all laced and bugged all twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning weak
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if
You only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
If you steal my sunshine
Making sure I'm not in too deep
If you steal my sunshine
Keeping versed and on my feet
...
It's Been One Week Since You Looked At Me
Cocked Your Head To One Side And Said I'm Angry
Five Days Since You Laughed At Me
Saying Get That Together Come Back And See Me
Three Days Since The Living Room
I Realized It's All My Fault But Couldn't Tell You
Yesterday You'd Forgiven Me
But It'll Still Be Two Days Till I Say I'm Sorry
Hold It Now And Watch The Hoodwink As I Make You Stop Think
You'll Think You're Looking At
Aquaman I Summon Fish To The Dish Although
I Like The Chalet Suisse And I Like
The Sushi 'Cause It's Never Touched A
Frying Pan Hot Like Wasabe When I Bust Rhymes Big Like Leanne Rimes
Because I'm All About Value Bert
Kaempfert's Got The Mad Hits You Try To
Match Wits You Try To Hold Me But I Bust Through
Gonna Make A Break And Take A Fake
I'd Like A Stinkin' Achin' Shake I Like
Vanilla It's The Finest Of The Flavours Gotta See The Show Cause Then
You'll Know The Vertigo Is Gonna
Grow 'Cause It's So Dangerous You'll Have
To Sign A Waiver
How Can I Help It If I Think You're Funny When You're Mad
...
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine
I look at you, lookin' at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I'm gonna love you boy you are so fine
Angel of mine
How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
You came into my life sent from above
When I lost all hope you showed me love
I'm checkin' for ya boy you're right on time
Angel of mine
Nothing means more to me than what we share
...
All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
Dance a little stranger show me, where you've been?
...
Kiss me out of the bearded barley
Nightly, beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
...
